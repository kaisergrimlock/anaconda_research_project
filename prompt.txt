Given a query and a passage, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 1 with the following meanings: 
1 for relevant: The passage is relevant to the query and answer it perfectly. 
0 for irrelevant: The passage has nothing to do with the query.  
Think of this as a striclty binary true or false question where relevant is 1 and irrelevant is 0. 
Make sure that all answers are integers.
Do not stray from the given parameters at any point. 
Label every single document, do not leave anything blank.
Assume that you are writing a report on the subject of the topic. 
A person has typed "{query}" into a search engine.
Consider the following passage: {passage}
Split this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O). Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {{"M": score, "T": score, "O": score}} Results {{}}
