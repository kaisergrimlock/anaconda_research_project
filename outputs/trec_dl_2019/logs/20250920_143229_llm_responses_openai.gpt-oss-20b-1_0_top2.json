The passage contains the answer: example of monotonic function. It says \"Figure 1. A monotonically increasing function ... Figure 2. A monotonically decreasing function.\" So it's a perfect example. So M=3. Trustworthiness: The passage seems like a snippet from a textbook or article. It's likely trustworthy. So T=3. O: final score maybe average? But they say \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So maybe O=3 as well. So output: {\"M\":3,\"T\":3,\"O\":3}. Ensure no extra text."

It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.\nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search.

They say \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows object. Probably they want an object with keys M, T, O. Provide scores 0-3. We need to evaluate the passage for query \"how long is life cycle of flea\". The passage does not mention length of life cycle. It mentions feeding for 12 hours to lay eggs. No mention of life cycle duration. So it's not answering. So relevance: 1? It's related but not answer. So M=1. Trustworthiness: unknown, but content seems generic. Could be moderate. T maybe 2? But we can set T=2? But trustworthiness maybe 2. O final maybe 1? Because overall relevance low. So output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}."

They say \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows object. Might be confusion. We need to output something like {\"M\": 1, \"T\": 1, \"O\": 1} maybe.

The passage: \"Causes of Pain on the Right Side of the Waist. Pain along the waist line may be caused by abnormal function of any of the organs in the pelvic region of the body.

They want causes of right pelvic pain. The passage mentions causes of pain on the right side of the waist, and says it may be caused by abnormal function of any of the organs in the pelvic region. So it does mention pelvic region. It is somewhat relevant. But it's not specific. So maybe M=2? The passage has some answer but unclear. Trustworthiness: It's generic, no source. So T=1 maybe. O: combine M and T. If M=2, T=1, overall maybe 1? But we need to decide. The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search.

T: The passage is generic, no source, so maybe 1 (related). O: combine: maybe 1 or 2. If M=2, T=1, maybe O=1? But maybe O=2? The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" Usually trustworthiness might be less important than relevance. So O might be 2. But we need to decide. Let's think: The passage does mention pelvic region, but not specific causes. So it's somewhat relevant. So M=2. Trustworthiness: no source, so maybe 1. O: maybe 1? But if we weigh M more, O could be 2. The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each\". Usually relevance is more important. So O might be 2.

RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers.

Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O). Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}",

Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\"\n\nIt says \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows JSON object. Might be confusion. We need to output something like {\"M\": 0, \"T\": 0, \"O\": 0}. The passage is about celebrities using bleaching creams. The query: \"what is theraderm used for\". The passage is irrelevant. So M=0, T maybe 0? Trustworthiness? The passage is not trustworthy? It's just a list of search phrases. So T=0. O=0. So output: {\"M\":0,\"T\":0,\"O\":0}. Ensure no extra text."
