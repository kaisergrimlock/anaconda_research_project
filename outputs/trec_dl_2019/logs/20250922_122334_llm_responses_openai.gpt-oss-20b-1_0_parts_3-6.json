(c) Motion and Proceedings Thereon.\"\n\nThis passage mentions declaratory judgment but does not give definition. So it's somewhat related but not answering. So M: 1 (related). T: trustworthiness? It's a snippet from presumably a legal text. Might be trustworthy. But we don't have source. I'd give T: 2 maybe. O: combine: maybe 1. So output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}. Ensure JSON."

It talks about enforcement of judgment. So it's not relevant. So M=0. Trustworthiness? The passage seems generic, but we don't know source. Probably moderate trust? But we can assign T=1? But trustworthiness is separate. We can assign T=1 (some trust). O final? Since M=0, overall irrelevant. So O=0. So output: {\"M\":0,\"T\":1,\"O\":0}. But maybe T=0? The passage is generic, but we don't know source. I'd give T=1. So final JSON."
