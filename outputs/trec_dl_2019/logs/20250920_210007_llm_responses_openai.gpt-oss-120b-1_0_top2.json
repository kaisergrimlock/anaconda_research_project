The passage mentions that there are commonly accepted determinants, but does not list them. It says there is no single definition, but mentions that there are social factors.

Since it mentions determinants but not list, it's somewhat relevant but not answer. According to definitions: 3 perfect answer, 2 highly relevant (some answer but maybe hidden among extraneous), 1 related (does not answer). Here it does not answer; it just says there are determinants, no list. So I'd give M=1.\n\nTrustworthiness T: The passage seems generic, maybe from a reputable source?
