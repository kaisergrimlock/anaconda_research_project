RSA RSA is a public key algorithm invented by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman. The key used for encryption is different from (but related to) the key used for decryption.The algorithm is based on modular exponentiation.hen talking of key lengths in connection with RSA, what is meant is the modulus length. An algorithm that uses different keys for encryption and decryption is said to be asymmetric. Anybody knowing the public key can use it khóa định nghĩa rsa to create encrypted messages, but only the owner of the secret key can decrypt them."
