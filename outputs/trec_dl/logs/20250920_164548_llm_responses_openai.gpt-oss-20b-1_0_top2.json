The passage: \"But I did it for you. With McDonald's recent release of the McDouble, they now have three basic, sub-$2 cheeseburgers: the cheeseburger, McDouble (two patties with one slice of cheese), and double cheeseburger (two patties with two slices of cheese).\"\n\nThis passage does answer the difference: McDouble has one slice of cheese, double cheeseburger has two slices. So it's highly relevant. Score M: 2. T: trustworthiness? It's likely from a website, but we don't know. It's a snippet. Might be moderately trustworthy. I'd give 2. O: final: 2. So output: {\"M\":2,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}."

The passage seems like a snippet from a textbook or article. Trustworthiness maybe 2. So O maybe 3? But we need to consider relative importance.

It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.\nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search.

RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers. Based on this principle, the RSA encryption algorithm uses prime factorization as the trap door for encryption. Deducing an RSA key, therefore, takes a huge amount of time and processing power.

O: final score: likely 3? But trustworthiness lower might reduce final? The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So we weigh M and T. M=3, T=2. Final maybe 3?

Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\"\n\nSo we need to output something like {\"M\": 0, \"T\": 0, \"O\": 0} maybe. But the passage is about celebrities using bleaching creams. The query: \"what is theraderm used for\". The passage is unrelated. So M=0, T maybe 0? The passage is not trustworthy? It's just a list of search phrases. So T=0. O=0. So output JSON array? The example shows a JSON object. It says \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows object. Might be confusion. But we should output a JSON object with keys M, T, O. So: {\"M\":0,\"T\":0,\"O\":0}."
