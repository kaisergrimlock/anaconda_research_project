The passage contains cost of interior concrete flooring: $92 per yard for 3000 psi. So it's relevant. It's not exactly the answer? The query: \"cost of interior concrete flooring\". The passage gives cost per yard for interior floors. So it's a direct answer. So M=3.\n\nT: Trustworthiness. It's a company statement. It's presumably trustworthy? It's a direct quote from a company. It's not a citation but it's a direct statement. We can consider trustworthiness moderate. But it's a company, so maybe 2. But guidelines: trustworthiness: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. But trustworthiness is separate. We need to evaluate trustworthiness of passage. It's a company statement, but no external verification. I'd give 2.\n\nO: overall score: maybe average or weighted? We need to compute overall. The guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" but no formula. Likely we can average M and T? Or maybe we choose the lower? But typical approach: overall is maybe average of M and T. So (3+2)/2 = 2.5, round to nearest integer? Probably 2. But maybe we can give 2.5? But must be integer 0-3. So maybe 2. So O=2.\n\nThus output: [{\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}]."

The price differences between a McDonald’s Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\"\n\nWe need to score M, T, O. M: relevance to query. The passage mentions McDouble and Double Cheeseburger, but it's about price differences, not the difference in composition. The query asks difference between a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger. The passage does mention both, but only in context of price differences. It does not answer the difference in ingredients. So it's partially relevant but not fully. According to guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. This is somewhat related but not answering. So M=1.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage is a review, presumably from a website. It's a review of Triple Cheeseburger, but mentions price differences. It's likely trustworthy? It's a review, but not necessarily authoritative. But it's a review, not a fact-check. The passage is not obviously unreliable. I'd give T=2? But guidelines: trustworthiness: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. But trustworthiness is about source reliability. This is a review, not a primary source. But it's likely credible. I'd give T=2.\n\nOverall score O: combine M and T. Usually O is overall relevance and trustworthiness. If M=1, T=2, overall maybe 1? But guidelines: O is overall score. We can compute average? But guidelines don't specify formula. We can choose O=1 or 2. Since M is low, overall low. I'd set O=1.\n\nThus output: [{\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}]."

Passage addresses growth of goldfish, yes. So M=3? The passage directly answers: goldfish will grow to depth of water, etc. So perfect relevance. So M=3.\n\nT: Trustworthiness. The passage seems factual, but we don't know source. It's a general statement. Might be trustworthy. But we can't be certain. But likely moderate trustworthiness. But guidelines: 3 perfect trustworthiness, 2 highly trustworthy, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. Since it's a factual statement about goldfish growth, likely trustworthy. I'd give T=2.\n\nO: Overall score. Usually average or weighted? We can compute average of M and T? But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" maybe combine. We can choose 3? But if T=2, overall maybe 2.5? But must be integer 0-3. We can choose 3? But if trustworthiness lower, overall maybe 2.5 but round? I'd choose 3? But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" maybe reflect both. I'd choose 3? But maybe 2? Let's think: M=3, T=2. Overall maybe 3? But if trustworthiness is not perfect, overall might be 2.5 but round to 3? But guidelines: integer 0-3. I'd choose 3? But maybe 2? Let's decide: overall should reflect both. I'd choose 3? But if trustworthiness is not perfect, overall might be 2.5 but round up? The guidelines don't specify rounding. I'd choose 3? But maybe 2? Let's choose 3? But risk of overrating. I'd choose 3? Let's think: The passage is relevant and somewhat trustworthy. So overall maybe 3? But trustworthiness 2 might lower overall. I'd choose 3? But maybe 2? Let's choose 3? Let's decide: overall = 3? But maybe 2? Let's choose 3? I'll choose 3. But I'm not sure. Let's read guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" no explicit formula. So we can decide. I'd choose 3 because it's highly relevant and fairly trustworthy. So O=3.\n\nThus output: [{\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}]."

The passage is about ecological anthropology, which is a subfield of anthropology that studies environment influence. The query is \"anthropological definition of environment\". The passage does not give a definition of environment, but it mentions environment influence. So it's somewhat related but not a direct definition. So M maybe 1 (related). T: trustworthiness.

But guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. For trustworthiness, we need to assess if the passage is trustworthy. It's a generic statement, likely from a textbook. I'd give T=2? But maybe 1? The passage is not a direct definition, but it's a statement. I'd give T=2? But trustworthiness is separate from relevance. I'd say it's somewhat trustworthy. So T=2. O: overall score: maybe average? But guidelines: overall score likely combine M and T. We can compute O as average? But not specified. We can just set O = M? Or maybe O = (M+T)/2?

                  "text": "We need to evaluate the passage. Query: \"causes of military suicide\". Passage: \"Suicide surpassed war as the military's leading cause of death. War was the leading cause of death in the military nearly every year between 2004 and 2011 until suicides became the top means dying for in 2012 and 2013, according to a bar chart published this week in a. Post to Facebook.\"\n\nWe need M: intent match. The passage mentions suicide as leading cause of death, but does not list causes of military suicide. The query is \"causes of military suicide\". The passage does not provide causes, just that suicide is leading cause. So it's related but not answering. So M=1. Trustworthiness: It's a snippet referencing a bar chart published this week in a. Post to Facebook. It's not clear source, but likely not highly trustworthy. But it's a statement. I'd give T=1 maybe. Overall O: combine M and T. Since M=1, T=1, O maybe 1. According to guidelines, O is overall score. Probably 1. So output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}."
