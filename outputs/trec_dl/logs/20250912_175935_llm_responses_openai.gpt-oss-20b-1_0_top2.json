This is in accordance with appellate decisions as well: Declaratory relief is a matter of district court discretion.\"\n\nThis passage does mention declaratory judgment action, but not definition. It is about discretion. So it's somewhat related but not giving definition. So M (match to query) maybe 1 (related). T (trustworthiness) unknown; assume moderate? The passage seems like a legal article; trustworthiness maybe 2? But we need to decide. The passage is not a definition. So M=1. T maybe 2? But we can set T=2. O final maybe 1? But we need to consider relative importance. M is likely more important. So O maybe 1. So produce JSON: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}."

The passage seems credible but not sure. But it's likely from a Q&A site. So T maybe 2. O final: maybe 3? But we need to consider relative importance. M is high, T moderate. So O maybe 3?

A non-monotonic function is a function that is increasing and decreasing on different intervals of its domain.

Actually x^2 is monotonic on [0,∞) but not on entire real line. They say \"non-monotonic function is a function that is increasing and decreasing on different intervals of its domain. For example, consider our initial example f(x) equals x 2.\" That is indeed a non-monotonic function.

RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers. Based on this principle, the RSA encryption algorithm uses prime factorization as the trap door for encryption. Deducing an RSA key, therefore, takes a huge amount of time and processing power.
