The query is \"cost of interior concrete flooring\". The passage indeed addresses cost of interior concrete flooring. So it's highly relevant. The passage is likely trustworthy? It's a website page about concrete staining cost. We don't know trustworthiness. But it's likely a commercial site. We can assign T maybe 2 or 3. The M (match) is high: 3. T maybe 2 or 3. O final maybe 3? The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).

They say \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows object. We'll follow example. So output: {\"M\": 3, \"T\": 3, \"O\": 3}. But maybe T 2?
