Query: \"anthropological definition of environment\". The passage mentions \"human ecology, the broad integrative area of anthropology that focuses on the interactions of culture, biology and the environment.\" It does not provide a definition of environment. It mentions environment as part of human ecology. So does it answer the query? No. It does not provide a definition. So M=1? It's related: same topic (anthropology, environment). But does not answer the definition. So M=1.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage is from a graduate program description. It has some specifics: \"graduate program in biological anthropology at CU Boulder offers training in several areas, including primatology, human biology, and paleoanthropology.\" It's credible but no citations. It's marketing fluff. So T=1? It's vague claims, marketing fluff. So T=1.\n\nNow overall: O starts with M=1. T=1, not 0. So O remains 1. So output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}. The instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array.\" So we output array? It says \"JSON array of scores\".

Wait example shows {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}. That seems ambiguous. They say \"JSON array of scores\". So maybe output like [{\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}]? But example shows a single object. The phrase \"JSON array of scores\" maybe means array of objects? But they say \"Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\". That example seems to show a single object. But they say \"JSON array of scores\" maybe they want an array of objects? Let's interpret: They want a JSON array of scores. So output something like [{\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}]. But the example shows just an object. Might be a mistake. But to be safe, produce an array with one object. That matches \"array of scores\". So output: [{\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}]. Let's compute scores.\n\nWe need to judge the passage relative to query: \"axon terminals or synaptic knob definition\". The passage provides definitions: \"Axon terminal – branches at the end of axon. Synaptic bulb (knob) – rounded area on the end of the axon terminal. Synaptic cleft (gap) – space between bulb of one cell and the dendrite of another. Receptor sites – holes is surface of dendrite; shaped to receive certain neurotransmitters.\"\n\nThe query: \"axon terminals or synaptic knob definition\". They want definition of axon terminals or synaptic knob. The passage gives definitions. So it's directly relevant. M=3. Trustworthiness: The passage is just definitions, no citations, no author. It's a short list. No sourcing signals. It's likely from some educational text but no source. So T=2? The guidelines: 3: Strong sourcing/authority, specific details, internally consistent. 2: Generally credible text without clear sourcing issues. 1: Vague claims, marketing fluff, hedging. 0: misinformation. The passage is specific, but no source. So T=2. O: Start with O=M=3. T=2, M=3, no adjustment. So O=3.\n\nThus output: [{\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}]."

So we output a JSON array containing one object? The example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}. That seems ambiguous. But likely they want a JSON object with keys M, T, O. But they say array. Let's interpret: produce a JSON array of scores. So maybe output: [{\"M\": 1, \"T\": 2, \"O\": 1}]. But the example shows just an object. But they say \"Results {}\".

Thank you for visiting our Concrete Staining Cost page, we will go over some of the options that are available for concrete staining for interior floors and the pricing for them. First, let's make sure you are using the right estimator for your project, here's a quick primer on concrete staining.\"\n\nThe query: \"cost of interior concrete flooring\"\n\nWe need to judge relevance. The passage is about stained concrete pricing for interior floors. It says \"we will go over some of the options that are available for concrete staining for interior floors and the pricing for them.\" So it addresses cost of interior concrete flooring? It specifically mentions interior floors and pricing. So it's relevant. But does it provide actual cost? It says \"we will go over some of the options ... and the pricing for them.\" It doesn't give actual numbers. So it's partially relevant but not fully answering. According to M scoring: 3 perfect answer; 2 highly relevant with correct answer but noise; 1 related; 0 irrelevant. Here, the passage does not give actual cost numbers, but indicates that it will discuss pricing. So it's not a direct answer. It's more like a preface. So M=1? Or maybe M=2? Let's interpret: The passage contains a correct/usable answer but surrounded by noise, partially complete, or requires minor inference. It says \"we will go over some of the options ... and the pricing for them.\" That is a promise to provide pricing, but not actual pricing. So it's not fully answering. So M=1? The guidelines: \"Contains a correct/usable answer but surrounded by noise, partially complete, or requires minor inference.\" The passage does not give actual cost. So it's not a correct answer. So M=1 (related). Yes.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage is marketing copy, no citations, no author. It's generic. So T=1 (vague claims, marketing fluff). So O: Start with O=M=1. T=1, not 0. So O stays 1.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}\n\nBut the instruction says \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows object. It says \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\"\n\nSo we output exactly that object. So final answer: {\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}"

Find out average prices and what design features contribute to the cost of concrete flooring. Get answers to common questions about the comfort and maintenance of concrete floors. Watch 68 videos with design ideas, and installation & maintenance tips for interior concrete floors. Get professional tips and design ideas for using stains to enhance concrete floors. Learn how polishing produces concrete floors with a high-gloss finish that never needs waxing.\"\n\nSo the passage says \"Find out average prices and what design features contribute to the cost of concrete flooring.\" That addresses cost. So M: 3? It's directly relevant. It says \"average prices\" but not specific numbers. But the query: \"cost of interior concrete flooring\". The passage says \"average prices\" and \"what design features contribute to the cost\". That is relevant. So M=3.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage seems like marketing copy, no citations, no author. It's generic. So T=1? It's vague claims, marketing fluff. So T=1.\n\nNow overall: Start with O=M=3. If T=0 and passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1. But T=1, so no reduction. If M=2 and T=3, increase. Not the case. So O=3.\n\nThus output: [{\"M\":3,\"T\":1,\"O\":3}].\n\nCheck formatting: JSON array of objects. No extra text. So final."

Let's see: M categories: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. The passage is somewhat relevant but not a direct definition. It might be considered highly relevant? It gives some context but not a definition. The query \"definition declaratory judgment\" likely expects a definition. The passage gives a description of the act, not the definition. So maybe M=2? Or M=1? Let's analyze: The passage is on the same topic (declaratory judgment). It does not answer the query fully. It gives some context but not a definition. So M=2? The guidelines: \"Contains a correct/usable answer but surrounded by noise, partially complete, or requires minor inference.\" The passage is not noisy, but partially complete. It doesn't give the definition. So maybe M=2. But maybe M=1 because it doesn't answer the query. The query is \"definition declaratory judgment\". The passage does not provide a definition. So M=1. Let's decide: The passage is related but does not answer the query. So M=1.\n\nNow trustworthiness T: The passage is a snippet from presumably a legal text. It has no citations, but it's fairly specific. No contradictions. So T=2? It's credible but no explicit sourcing. So T=2.\n\nNow overall O: Start with O=M=1.

Let's see: M categories: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant.

The passage: \"AIRMETS/SIGMETS issued by authorities forecasting significant weather events that are potentially hazardous to flights in the area for which they are issued, refreshed every 30 min. Click on an AIRMET/SIGMET to see the full text.\"\n\nWe need to evaluate M, T, O.\n\nFirst, interpret query: \"definition of a sigmet\". The user wants definition. The passage gives a definition: \"AIRMETS/SIGMETS issued by authorities forecasting significant weather events that are potentially hazardous to flights in the area for which they are issued, refreshed every 30 min.\" That is a definition. So M=3 (perfectly relevant). It's a direct, focused answer. There's no noise. So M=3.\n\nNow T: trustworthiness. The passage is presumably from an authoritative source? It says \"issued by authorities\". No citations, but it's a factual statement. It's specific. No contradictions. It's likely credible. So T=2? Let's see: \"Consider sourcing signals visible in the passage (citations, author/affiliation, specificity, internal consistency, datedness if stated).\" There's no citations, but it's a factual statement. It's specific. It's internally consistent. No contradictions. So T=2 (generally credible). Could be T=3? But no explicit source. So T=2.\n\nNow O: Start with O=M=3. If T=0 and passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1. Not the case. If M=2 and T=3, increase O. Not the case. So O=3.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}. The instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array.\" Wait: \"JSON array of scores\" - but example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}. The example shows a JSON object, not array. The instruction says \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows object. Might be ambiguous. The example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}. That seems to be a JSON object. So we should output a JSON object. The phrase \"JSON array of scores\" might be a mistake. We'll output JSON object.\n\nThus final answer: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}."

The user wants a comparison. The passage indeed provides a comparison: difference in meat quality, gristle, flavor, filler. So it addresses the query. It's fairly direct. So M likely 3 (perfectly relevant). There's no noise. It's a direct answer. So M=3.\n\nNow T: trustworthiness. The passage has no citations, no author, no source. It's just a statement. It's somewhat vague: \"whatever meat filler they use to fill the gap.\" No evidence. So T likely 1: vague claims, marketing fluff, minor inconsistencies. There's no sourcing. So T=1.\n\nNow O: Start with O=M=3. If T=0 and passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1. But T=1, not 0. If M=2 and T=3, increase O. Not the case. So keep O=3. But we might consider that T=1 might reduce O? The rule: \"If T = 0 and the passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1.\" T is not 0. So no reduction.

The passage mentions the price differences between a McDonald's Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger. It says they all fall within 50 cents of one another. So it does mention difference between McDouble and Double Cheeseburger. It gives a price difference context. The query is about difference between McDouble and Double Cheeseburger. The passage provides that difference: price difference within 50 cents. It doesn't give other differences like ingredients, but price difference is a difference. The query likely wants difference in terms of ingredients or price? The query ambiguous. But the passage addresses price difference. So it partially answers. It's not fully detailed but gives a direct answer. So M=2? Let's see: M=3 if direct, focused answer or uniquely on-topic content; answers the query clearly and fully. The passage gives a partial answer: price difference within 50 cents. That is a direct answer. It might be considered fully answering the price difference. The query didn't specify price difference, but difference could be price or composition. The passage only covers price difference. So it's partially answering. So M=2.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage is a review, but no citations. It's a review of Triple Cheeseburger. It mentions price differences. No source. It's somewhat credible but not strongly sourced. So T=2? The passage is generally credible text without clear sourcing issues. So T=2.\n\nNow overall: Start with O=M=2. T=2, M=2. The rule: If M=2 and T=3 and answer slightly obscured, increase to 3. But T=2, not 3. So keep O=2. Also check if T=0 and passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1. Not the case. So O=2.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":2,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}."

The phrase \"JSON array of scores\" might mean a JSON object with keys M, T, O. The example shows that. So we output {\"M\": ..., \"T\": ..., \"O\": ...}. No other text.\n\nWe need to evaluate the passage for the query \"difference between rn and bsn\". The passage: \"An RN to BSN Completion program is now offered by many institutions to accommodate registered nurses who already have their associate's degree or a diploma level degree. Before deciding if an RN to BSN Completion program is the next step for you, it's important to understand the differences. Potential Differences in Salary Between an RN and a BSN Degree. Initially, an RN and a nurse with a BSN degree might both receive the same salary for the same nursing position.\"\n\nSo the passage mentions differences, specifically salary differences. The query: \"difference between rn and bsn\". The passage addresses differences, but only mentions salary differences, not other differences. The query likely expects a comparison of RN vs BSN. The passage partially answers: it says differences exist, mentions salary differences. It doesn't fully answer the question. So M likely 2? Let's analyze.\n\nM scoring: 3 if direct, focused answer or uniquely on-topic content; answers the query clearly and fully. 2 if contains a correct/usable answer but surrounded by noise, partially complete, or requires minor inference. 1 if related but does not answer the query (definitions/background/listings without asked-for detail). 0 if irrelevant.\n\nThe passage: It says \"Before deciding if an RN to BSN Completion program is the next step for you, it's important to understand the differences.\" Then \"Potential Differences in Salary Between an RN and a BSN Degree. Initially, an RN and a nurse with a BSN degree might both receive the same salary for the same nursing position.\" So it gives a partial answer: salary differences. But the query likely expects a broader difference. The passage partially addresses but not fully. So M=2.\n\nNow T: trustworthiness. The passage has no citations, no author, no specifics. It's generic. So T=1? Let's see: 3: strong sourcing/authority, specific details, internally consistent. 2: generally credible text without clear sourcing issues. 1: vague claims, marketing fluff, noticeable hedging, or minor inconsistencies. 0: misinformation, contradictions, spam. The passage is generic, no citations, but not obviously misinformation. It's marketing fluff? It says \"An RN to BSN Completion program is now offered by many institutions to accommodate registered nurses who already have their associate's degree or a diploma level degree.\" That is generic. So T=1.\n\nNow O: Start with O=M=2. If T=0 and passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1. Not the case. If M=2 and T=3 and answer slightly obscured, increase O to 3. Not the case. So O=2.\n\nThus output: {\"M\": 2, \"T\": 1, \"O\": 2}"

Wait: They say \"JSON array of scores\" maybe array of objects? The example shows a single object. But they say \"array of scores\" maybe just one object. We'll output a single object inside array? The example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}. That seems to show a single object. But they say \"JSON array of scores\" maybe they want array of objects? The example shows object not array. But they say \"Results {}\" maybe placeholder. I'd output a single object: {\"M\": 3, \"T\": 2, \"O\": 3}. But they said \"array\" maybe they want [ {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3} ]. Let's read: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\"\n\nThe example shows a single object, not array.

T: The passage has no citations, but it's a short answer. No author info. It's a factual claim. No obvious misinformation. So T=2 (generally credible). O: M=3, T=2, no reduction.

Yes, says they usually grow with environment, can keep growing if large space and fed enough. So it's a direct answer. So M=3? It's directly relevant. There's no noise.

This is the idea that they grow to the size of their tank comes from.\"\n\nWe need to evaluate M, T, O.\n\nFirst, interpret query: \"do goldfish grow\" is informational: user wants to know if goldfish grow. The passage says: \"Goldfish grow until they are at their mature size, but being in a small tank for them to grow can cause stunting.\" So it answers the question: yes, goldfish grow until mature size. So M should be 3 (perfectly relevant). There's no noise, it's directly answering. So M=3.\n\nNow T: trustworthiness. The passage has no citations, no author, no source. It's a short statement. It's not obviously misinformation. It's a factual claim about goldfish growth. There's no contradictory info. It's consistent. But no sourcing. So T=2? The guidelines: 3: strong sourcing/authority, specific details, internally consistent. 2: generally credible text without clear sourcing issues. 1: vague claims, marketing fluff, hedging. 0: misinformation. The passage is fairly specific: \"Goldfish grow until they are at their mature size, but being in a small tank for them to grow can cause stunting.\" It's a factual claim. No source.

The phrase \"JSON array of scores\" might mean an array of objects? But example shows a single object.

It mentions monotonic functions in probability theory, cumulative distribution function is monotonically increasing. That is an example: CDF is monotonic increasing. But the query: \"example of monotonic function\". The passage does mention CDF as an example. But the passage is incomplete: \"If is a random variable, its cumulative distribution function is a monotonically increasing function.\" It seems truncated. But still, it mentions CDF as an example. The passage also mentions unimodal functions. But does it provide a concrete example? Not a specific function like f(x)=x or f(x)=x^2. So it's not a direct example. It's more of a definition. So M likely 1 (related). Because it is on the same topic but does not answer the query (no explicit example). So M=1.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage seems like a snippet from a textbook or article. No citations, but it's consistent. No contradictions. So T=2 (generally credible). No clear sourcing but not misinformation. So T=2.\n\nNow overall: Start with O=M=1. T=2, M=1. The rule: If M=2 and T=3, increase O. Not applicable. If T=0 and passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O. Not the case. So O remains 1.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}."

The instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array.

But we should output something like {\"M\": 2, \"T\": 2, \"O\": 2}. Let's analyze.\n\nWe have a passage about monotonic functions. The query: \"example of monotonic function\". The passage includes Figure 1 and Figure 2 descriptions, and a definition. The passage does not provide a concrete example, but it describes monotonic functions and includes figures. The query is informational: wants an example. The passage does not give a specific example, but it does show a figure of a monotonically increasing function and a decreasing function. That might be considered an example? The passage says \"Figure 1. A monotonically increasing function (it is strictly increasing on the left and right while just non-decreasing in the middle.). Figure 2. A monotonically decreasing function.\" So it references figures that presumably show examples. But the text itself does not give a concrete function like f(x)=x^2 or f(x)=sin(x). It just describes the figure. So does it answer the query? The query: \"example of monotonic function\". The passage gives a description of a monotonic function but not a specific example. It might be considered partially relevant. According to M scoring: 3 perfect: direct, focused answer. 2 highly relevant: correct answer but surrounded by noise or partially complete. 1 related: on same topic but does not answer. 0 irrelevant.\n\nWe have a definition and mention of figures. The passage does not give a concrete example. So maybe M=1? But maybe M=2 because it does provide an example via figure description. But the description is not a function expression. The user likely wants an example like f(x)=x^2. The passage does not provide that. So I'd lean M=1. But let's consider the guidelines: \"If the passage satisfies one plausible high-frequency intent for the query, score against that; don’t average intents.\" The query is \"example of monotonic function\". The passage includes a definition and mentions figures. The user might accept that as an example? The passage says \"Figure 1. A monotonically increasing function (it is strictly increasing on the left and right while just non-decreasing in the middle.). Figure 2. A monotonically decreasing function.\" That is an example of monotonic functions. So maybe M=2? Because it contains a correct answer but is partially complete? The passage does not give the function explicitly but describes the shape. That might be considered an example. I'd say M=2.\n\nNow trustworthiness T: The passage is a snippet from a text, no citations, no author. It's a definition. It's consistent. No contradictions. So T=2 (generally credible). No strong sourcing. So T=2.\n\nNow overall O: Start with O=M=2. T=2, M=2. The rule: If M=2 and T=3 and answer slightly obscured, increase to 3. But T=2, not 3. So keep O=2.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":2,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}. Ensure JSON object."

Cold blooded although if you've ever seen a Great White Shark hunt sea lions you'd be thinking they would have to be hotblooded. Actually the Salmon Shark is a warm blooded shark.\"\n\nWe need to determine M, T, O.\n\nFirst, underlying intent: informational. The user asks \"how are some sharks warm blooded\". They want explanation of how some sharks are warm-blooded. The passage says some sharks are partially warmblooded, e.g., Mako, Great white, Salmon. It says \"Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms).\" It also says \"Actually the Salmon Shark is a warm blooded shark.\" It doesn't explain how they are warm-blooded, just states that they are. So does it answer the query? The query: \"how are some sharks warm blooded\". The passage does not explain the mechanism, just states that some are warm-blooded. So it's partially answering? The query is \"how are some sharks warm blooded\" meaning \"how are they warm-blooded\" i.e., what makes them warm-blooded. The passage says \"Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms).\" That indicates they are endotherms, but doesn't explain the mechanism. So it's not fully answering. So M likely 1 (related). Because it mentions the topic but doesn't answer the question fully. It doesn't provide explanation of how they are warm-blooded. So M=1.\n\nNow T: trustworthiness. The passage has no citations, no author, no source. It's a short statement. It's somewhat consistent but not strongly sourced. So T=1 (vague claims, no sourcing). There's no contradictions. So T=1.\n\nNow O: Start with O=M=1. If T=0 and passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1. But T=1, not 0. If M=2 and T=3, increase O. Not the case. So O remains 1.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}."

It doesn't list all warm-blooded sharks, but gives an example. The query: \"how are some sharks warm blooded\" maybe they want to know which sharks are warm-blooded. The passage gives one example. So M: 2? It's relevant, but not fully exhaustive. It's a correct answer but partial. So M=2.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage has no citations, but it's a factual statement. No author info. It's a simple statement. So T=2? It's generally credible text without clear sourcing issues. There's no contradictions. So T=2.\n\nNow overall: M=2, T=2.

The phrase \"JSON array of scores\" maybe means a JSON object with keys M, T, O. The example shows that. So we output {\"M\": X, \"T\": Y, \"O\": Z}. No other text.\n\nWe need to evaluate the passage for the query: \"how are some sharks warm blooded\". The passage: \"Some fish are ectothermic such as the Blue shark whereas others are endothermic such as swordfish and Lamnid sharks.ndothermic = warm-blooded Ectothermic = cold-blooded Endotherms are able to maintain their own body temperature, whereas Ectotherms rely on their environment to regulate body â¦ temperature.\"\n\nWe need to judge M, T, O.\n\nFirst, underlying intent: informational. The user asks how some sharks are warm-blooded. The passage says some fish are ectothermic such as Blue shark whereas others are endothermic such as swordfish and Lamnid sharks. So it mentions that some sharks are endothermic (warm-blooded). It gives examples: swordfish and Lamnid sharks. It also defines endothermic vs ectothermic. So it does answer the question: \"how are some sharks warm blooded?\" It says they are endothermic, can maintain their own body temperature. So it's a direct answer. So M=3 (perfectly relevant). There's no noise? The passage is short, but includes the answer. So M=3.\n\nNow T: trustworthiness. The passage has no citations, no author, no date. It's a snippet. It says \"Some fish are ectothermic such as the Blue shark whereas others are endothermic such as swordfish and Lamnid sharks.ndothermic = warm-blooded Ectothermic = cold-blooded Endotherms are able to maintain their own body temperature, whereas Ectotherms rely on their environment to regulate body â¦ temperature.\" It's somewhat garbled: \"ndothermic\" maybe a typo. There's no clear sourcing. So T=1? The passage is vague, no citations, but it's not obviously misinformation. It's a factual claim that some sharks are endothermic. That is true. But no source. So T=1 (vague claims, marketing fluff, minor inconsistencies). There's a minor inconsistency: \"Blue shark\" is actually a lamnid shark, but the passage says Blue shark is ectothermic. That might be inaccurate. But we don't know. But we can consider T=1.\n\nNow O: Start with O=M=3. If T=0 and passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1. But T=1, not 0. If M=2 and T=3, increase O. Not applicable. So O=3.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":3,\"T\":1,\"O\":3}."

It says \"Cold blooded\" but then \"warm blooded shark\". It's confusing. It doesn't provide a clear answer. So M likely 1 (related).

The passage gives info about flea life cycle: larvae remain in cocoon from one week to one year. That is part of life cycle length. The question: \"how long is life cycle of flea\" likely expects a time period for entire life cycle. The passage gives a range for the pupal stage, but not the entire life cycle. But it does mention that larvae can remain in cocoon anywhere from one week to one year. That is a part of life cycle. The question is ambiguous: could be entire life cycle length. The passage partially answers: gives a range for pupal stage. So M=2? Let's analyze.\n\nM scoring: 3 perfect answer: direct, focused answer. The passage does not give full life cycle length, only pupal stage. So not perfect. 2 highly relevant: contains correct answer but surrounded by noise or partial. The passage is short, no noise. It gives partial answer. So M=2.\n\nT: trustworthiness. No citations, no author. It's a short statement. No obvious misinformation. It's plausible. So T=2.\n\nNow O: Start with O=M=2. T=2, M=2.

The phrase \"JSON array of scores\" might mean a JSON array containing objects? But example shows a single object. The instruction: \"Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\" That seems to show a single object. So we should output a JSON object with keys M, T, O.\n\nWe need to evaluate the passage for the query \"how to find the midsegment of a trapezoid\". The passage: \"The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the nonparallel sides of a trapezoid.

It seems incomplete: \"The midsegment below can be found by. 1 calculating the lengths of the bases. 2 35-16 = 9 (length of upper base). 3 45-0 =45 (length of lower base). 4 calculating the sum of the bases.\" It doesn't give the final step: average of bases? The midsegment length is average of bases. But the passage doesn't state that. It just says \"calculating the sum of the bases.\" So it's incomplete. But it does provide some steps. The query: \"how to find the midsegment of a trapezoid\". The passage partially answers: definition, steps to find length? It doesn't give the formula for midsegment length. It gives steps to find lengths of bases, but not the midsegment. So it's partially relevant but incomplete. According to scoring: M=2 (highly relevant) because it contains a correct/usable answer but surrounded by noise, partially complete, or requires minor inference. The passage is somewhat incomplete but gives some steps. So M=2.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage has no citations, no author, no source. It's a simple explanation. No contradictions. It's consistent. So T=2 (generally credible text without clear sourcing issues). There's no misinformation. So T=2.\n\nNow overall O: Start with O=M=2. T=2, M=2. The rule: If M=2 and T=3 and answer only slightly obscured, increase O to 3. But T=2, not 3. So keep O=2. Also check if T=0 and passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1. Not the case. So O=2.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":2,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}."

Getting to Paris from Charles de Gaulle is easy with RATP buses, taxis and limousines all operating from Paris CDG.\"\n\nQuery: \"is cdg airport in main paris\". The user likely asks if CDG airport is in main Paris. The passage says CDG is 14 miles northeast of Paris. So answer: No, it's not in main Paris; it's outside but near. The passage provides that info. So M: 3? The passage directly answers: \"Charles de Gaulle Airport is 14 miles (23 kilometers) northeast of Paris\". That addresses the question. So M=3.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage seems factual, but no citations. It's a general description. No author. It's likely from Wikipedia. But no explicit source. So T=2: generally credible text without clear sourcing issues.\n\nOverall: M=3, T=2. Since M=3, O=3. No adjustment needed. So output: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}."

The query: \"is cdg airport in main paris\". The user asks if CDG airport is in main Paris. The passage says it's in Paris, France. So answer: yes, it's in Paris. So M: 3 (perfectly relevant).

According to guidelines: 3: Strong sourcing/authority, specific details, internally consistent. 2: Generally credible text without clear sourcing issues. 1: Vague claims, marketing fluff, hedging. 0: misinformation. The passage is specific: \"Charles de Gaulle International Airport. 1 Paris, France. 2 IATA airport code CDG. 3 ICAO airport code LFPG.\" It's consistent. So T=2? Or 3? There's no explicit source, but it's a factual statement. The guidelines: 3: Strong sourcing/authority, specific details, internally consistent. The passage has specific details: location, codes. It's internally consistent. But no source. But still could be considered credible. I'd lean T=2. Because no explicit source. So T=2.\n\nNow O: Start with O=M=3.

Airlines and flights can be found on en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle_International_Airport.\"\n\nWe need to evaluate M, T, O.\n\nFirst, interpret query: \"is cdg airport in main paris\". Likely user wants to know if CDG airport is in main Paris (i.e., central Paris). The passage says \"Charles De Gaulle International Airport (CDG) in Paris.\" That indicates it's in Paris. But does it say \"main Paris\"? It says \"in Paris\" but not \"main Paris\". The user might be asking if CDG is in central Paris. The passage does not specify central or main. It just says in Paris. So does it answer the query? The query: \"is cdg airport in main paris\". The passage says \"in Paris\". That partially answers: yes, it's in Paris. But does it address \"main\"? No. So maybe M=2? Let's see guidelines: M=3 if direct, focused answer or uniquely on-topic content; answers the query clearly and fully. M=2 if contains correct answer but surrounded by noise, partially complete, or requires minor inference. M=1 if on same topic but does not answer the query (definitions/background/listings without asked-for detail). M=0 if off-topic.\n\nThe passage says \"Charles De Gaulle International Airport (CDG) in Paris.\" That is a direct answer: yes, CDG is in Paris. The user asked \"in main paris\". The passage doesn't mention \"main\". But the user might interpret \"main Paris\" as \"Paris\" in general. The passage is fairly direct. There's no noise. So M=2? Or M=3? The passage is short, no noise. It directly states \"in Paris\". That is a correct answer. The user might want to know if it's in central Paris. The passage doesn't specify central. So it's partially incomplete. So M=2.\n\nNow T: trustworthiness. The passage includes a link to Wikipedia. It has specific codes: IATA code CDG, ICAO code LFPG. It's factual. No obvious misinformation. It's credible. So T=3.\n\nNow O: Start with O=M=2. If T=0 and passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1. Not the case. If M=2 and T=3 and answer is only slightly obscured, you may increase O to 3. The answer is only slightly obscured: the user asked \"main Paris\" but passage says \"in Paris\". That is slightly obscured. So we can increase O to 3. So O=3.\n\nThus JSON array: {\"M\":2,\"T\":3,\"O\":3}."

This airport has international and domestic flights from Paris, France and is 40 km from the center of Disneyland Paris.\"\n\nQuery: \"is cdg airport in main paris\"\n\nInterpretation: The user asks if CDG airport is in main Paris. They likely want to know if CDG is in central Paris or main Paris. The passage says nearest major airport is CDG, and it has flights from Paris, France, and is 40 km from Disneyland Paris. It doesn't explicitly say CDG is in main Paris. It says it's an airport in Paris, France. But the question: \"is cdg airport in main paris\" ambiguous. They might mean \"is CDG airport in central Paris?\" The passage says it's an airport in Paris, but not central. It says 40 km from Disneyland Paris. That suggests it's not in main Paris. The passage does not directly answer the question. It says it's an airport in Paris, but not that it's in main Paris. So M=1? Let's analyze.\n\nWe need to consider the underlying intent: informational. The user wants to know if CDG is in main Paris. The passage says it's an airport in Paris, but not central. The passage does not directly answer the question. So M=1 (related). T: The passage has specific details: \"Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport (CDG / LFPG). This airport has international and domestic flights from Paris, France and is 40 km from the center of Disneyland Paris.\" It's specific, no citations but seems credible. So T=2 (generally credible). O: Start with O=M=1. T=2, M=1, no special rule. So O=1.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}. But the instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning.

The passage: \"We've got 73 definitions for LPS Â» What does LPS stand for? What does LPS mean? This page is about the various possible meanings of the acronym, abbreviation, shorthand or slang term: LPS.\"\n\nThe query: \"lps laws definition\". The user typed \"lps laws definition\" into a search engine. The passage is about definitions of LPS, but not specifically \"laws definition\". The passage says \"73 definitions for LPS\" but not about laws. The user likely wants definition of \"LPS laws\" maybe \"LPS laws\" meaning \"LPS\" as an acronym for \"Laws\" or \"LPS laws\" maybe \"LPS\" stands for \"Laws\" or \"LPS laws\" maybe \"LPS\" stands for \"Laws\" or \"LPS\" stands for \"LPS\" but the user wants definition of \"lps laws\". The passage does not mention \"laws\" or \"law\" at all. It just says definitions for LPS. So does it answer the query? The query: \"lps laws definition\". The passage: \"We've got 73 definitions for LPS\" and \"What does LPS stand for? What does LPS mean? This page is about the various possible meanings of the acronym, abbreviation, shorthand or slang term: LPS.\" So it gives definitions of LPS but not specifically \"laws\". The user might be looking for \"LPS laws definition\" meaning \"LPS\" as an acronym for \"Laws\" or \"LPS laws\" maybe \"LPS\" stands for \"Laws\" or \"LPS\" stands for \"LPS\" but the user wants definition of \"lps laws\". The passage does not mention \"laws\" or \"law\" or \"law definition\". So it's not directly answering the query. It's somewhat related: it's about definitions of LPS. But the user specifically wants \"lps laws definition\". The passage does not provide that. So M=1 (related). T: The passage is generic, no citations, no author, no specifics. It's a generic page. So T=1 (vague claims, marketing fluff). O: Start with O=M=1. T=1, not 0, so no reduction. M=1, T=1, no special increase. So O=1.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}. But the instruction says produce a JSON array of scores. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}. That example shows a single object. But \"JSON array of scores\" might mean an array of objects? The example shows a single object. But \"JSON array of scores\" could be ambiguous. The instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\"\n\nIt says \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows a single object. Maybe they want an array with one object? But the example shows just an object, not an array. The phrase \"JSON array of scores\" might be a mistake. But we should follow the example: produce a JSON object. So output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}. No other text."

But example shows a single object. They say \"Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\". That seems like they want a single JSON object. But earlier they said \"JSON array of scores\". Might be a mistake. Let's interpret: They want a JSON object with keys M, T, O. So output {\"M\": X, \"T\": Y, \"O\": Z}. No other text.\n\nNow evaluate the passage: \"The Law and Ethyl Alcohol ..................................... 8. Equistar Chemicals, LP and Industrial Ethyl Alcohol ..................... 9.

The passage is just a list of headings, no sourcing. So T=0? But it's not misinformation, just irrelevant. So T=0. O = M = 0. So output {\"M\":0,\"T\":0,\"O\":0}."

Let's see: \"Direct, focused answer or uniquely on-topic content; answers the query clearly and fully (for the likely intent).\" The passage gives definition of LP and LLP, difference, general partner, limited partner. That is a direct answer. So M=3.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage has no citations, but it's fairly straightforward. No contradictions. It's a simple definition. So T=2? The guidelines: 3: Strong sourcing/authority, specific details, internally consistent. 2: Generally credible text without clear sourcing issues. 1: Vague claims, marketing fluff, hedging. 0: misinformation. The passage is credible, but no source. So T=2.\n\nNow O: Start with O=M=3. If T=0 and passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1. Not the case. If M=2 and T=3, increase O. Not the case. So O=3.\n\nThus output: [{\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}]. Ensure no spaces? They didn't specify formatting. Provide JSON array. Let's output exactly: [{\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}]."

The passage: \"Definition of RTU in Construction Roof top units. The RTU is a piece of mechanical equipment that is designed to heat, cool, ventilate by providing air flow for any combination of the three.\"\n\nWe need to evaluate M, T, O.\n\nFirst, interpret query: \"medicare's definition of mechanical ventilation\". The user wants definition of mechanical ventilation as per Medicare. The passage is about RTU in construction, not about Medicare or mechanical ventilation. So it's irrelevant. M=0.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage is a definition of RTU, not about Medicare. No citations. It's not relevant. T=0? The passage is not misinformation but irrelevant. But trustworthiness criteria: \"Consider sourcing signals visible in the passage (citations, author/affiliation, specificity, internal consistency, datedness if stated).\" The passage has no citations, no author, no date. It's a generic definition. So T=1? But it's not misinformation. It's just lacking sourcing. According to guidelines: 3: strong sourcing/authority, specific details, internally consistent. 2: generally credible text without clear sourcing issues. 1: vague claims, marketing fluff, noticeable hedging, or minor inconsistencies. 0: evident misinformation, contradictions, or spammy/templated content. This passage is a simple definition, no sourcing, but not misinformation. So T=1? But it's not marketing fluff. It's a straightforward definition. Might be considered 2: generally credible text without clear sourcing issues. But it's not authoritative. I'd lean T=1? Let's think: The passage is a definition of RTU, not Medicare. It's not misinformation. It's not marketing fluff. It's a simple statement. I'd assign T=1? But the guidelines: \"Generally credible text without clear sourcing issues\" is 2. \"Vague claims, marketing fluff, noticeable hedging, or minor inconsistencies\" is 1. This passage is not vague; it's a clear definition. So maybe T=2. But it's not authoritative. But the guidelines don't require authority for T=2. So T=2.\n\nNow O: Start with O=M=0. If T=0 and passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1. But T is not 0. So O stays 0.\n\nThus final JSON: {\"M\":0,\"T\":2,\"O\":0}. But we need JSON array?

The passage: \"Some women develop serious complications during pregnancy that cause different types of pain. If you have pelvic pain that's coupled with certain symptoms, such as fever and bleeding, be sure to call your doctor right away. Here are the more serious causes of pelvic pain during pregnancy. Miscarriage.\"\n\nWe need to evaluate M, T, O.\n\nFirst, interpret query intent: \"right pelvic pain causes\". Likely informational: user wants causes of right pelvic pain. The passage mentions serious complications during pregnancy causing different types of pain, and lists miscarriage as a cause. It does not specifically mention right pelvic pain or list causes beyond miscarriage. So does it answer the query? It partially addresses causes of pelvic pain during pregnancy, but not specifically right pelvic pain. The passage is incomplete. So M likely 1 (related) or 2? Let's see: The passage does mention causes of pelvic pain, but not specifically right pelvic pain. The user might be looking for causes of right pelvic pain in general, not just pregnancy. The passage is about pregnancy. So it's partially relevant but not fully. So M=1? Or M=2? The guidelines: M=3 perfect; M=2 highly relevant: contains correct answer but surrounded by noise, partially complete, or requires minor inference. M=1 related: on same topic but does not answer the query. The passage does mention causes of pelvic pain, but not specifically right pelvic pain. The user might be looking for causes of right pelvic pain. The passage gives one cause: miscarriage. But miscarriage is a cause of pelvic pain during pregnancy, not necessarily right pelvic pain. So it's not fully answering. So M=1.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage has no citations, no author, no specifics. It's a generic statement. So T=1? The guidelines: T=3 strong sourcing; T=2 generally credible; T=1 vague claims, marketing fluff, hedging. This passage is vague, no sourcing. So T=1.\n\nNow O: Start with O=M=1. If T=0 and passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1. T is not 0. If M=2 and T=3, increase O. Not the case. So O remains 1.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}.

The passage mentions \"Causes of Pain on the Right Side of the Waist Pain along the waist line may be caused by abnormal function of any of the organs in the pelvic region of the body.\" That is somewhat relevant: it says causes of pain on the right side of the waist, may be caused by abnormal function of organs in pelvic region. So it addresses causes of right pelvic pain. But it's vague, no specifics. The passage is short, no citations. So M: 2? It's somewhat relevant but not fully detailed. It's not a perfect answer. So M=2. T: no citations, no author, vague. So T=1. O: Start with O=M=2. T=1 not 0, so no reduction. M=2 and T=3? No, T=1. So O stays 2. So output: {\"M\":2,\"T\":1,\"O\":2}. The instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array.\" So we output array? It says \"JSON array of scores\".

But the example shows a single object. The phrase \"JSON array of scores\" might mean an array of objects? But the example shows a single object. The safe approach: output a JSON object. But they said array. But the example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}. That seems like a single object. So I'll output a single JSON object. No extra text."

This passage is not fully answering; it's about generating keys on Cisco device, not definition. So not perfect. M=2: Contains a correct/usable answer but surrounded by noise, partially complete, or requires minor inference. Yes. So M=2.\n\nT: trustworthiness. The passage seems like a snippet from Cisco documentation. It has specific details, internal consistency. No citations but it's likely credible. So T=2? The passage is generally credible text without clear sourcing issues. So T=2.\n\nNow O: Start with O=M=2. T=2, M=2. The rule: If M=2 and T=3 and answer only slightly obscured, increase O to 3.

They likely want a definition of RSA key. The passage defines PEM encoded RSA private key, but not a general definition of RSA key. It mentions format that stores RSA private key. It does not define RSA key itself. So does it answer? It's partially relevant but not fully. The query is ambiguous: \"rsa definition key\" could mean definition of RSA key. The passage gives definition of PEM encoded RSA private key. That is somewhat relevant but not fully answering. So M=2? Let's see: M=3 if direct, focused answer. M=2 if correct answer but noise or partial. M=1 if related but not answer. The passage gives a definition of PEM encoded RSA private key, but not definition of RSA key. The user likely wants definition of RSA key. So it's partially relevant. I'd give M=2. T: The passage is a short statement, no citations, but it's factual. No contradictions. So T=2. O: M=2, T=2, no special conditions. So O=2.\n\nThus output: [{\"M\":2,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}]."

It says key used for encryption is different from key used for decryption. That is correct. It says algorithm based on modular exponentiation. That is correct. It says key lengths refer to modulus length. That is correct. It says algorithm that uses different keys is asymmetric. That is correct. It says anyone knowing public key can create encrypted messages, only owner of secret key can decrypt. That is correct. So it's credible. No obvious misinformation. So T=2? The guidelines: 3: Strong sourcing/authority, specific details, internally consistent. 2: Generally credible text without clear sourcing issues. 1: Vague claims, marketing fluff, hedging. 0: misinformation.

The instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\"\n\nMaybe they want a single JSON object? The example shows a JSON object. But they say \"JSON array of scores\". Could be array of objects? But only one passage. So maybe just a single object. The example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}. That seems like they want the object.

Passage: \"RSA encryption is based on use of a public and a private key. Typically a key fob (such as an RSA SecurID security token) is used by employees in security-sensitive companies. The token generates a public key that changes every minute.\" It mentions RSA encryption uses public and private key. So it gives definition of RSA key? It says encryption based on use of a public and private key. That is definition. So M=3? It's directly relevant, focused answer. It answers query: definition of RSA key. So M=3.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage seems like marketing copy: \"RSA makes the public key infrastructure (PKI) encryption standards by which much of the Internet’s secure communication are run. Other RSA products include hardware token s, software tokens, SecurID, Besafe and enVision.\" It's somewhat generic, no citations. But it's fairly specific. No contradictions. So T=2?

They want types of dysarthria that arise from cerebral palsy. The passage does not list types of dysarthria. It only says dysarthria is caused by cerebral palsy. It does not provide types. So the passage does not answer the query. It's related but not answering. So M=1 (related). T: The passage is a short list of facts, no citations, but seems credible. No contradictions.

The passage is not providing info about dysarthria. It's irrelevant. So T=0? The passage is not misinformation but irrelevant. According to guidelines, if passage is irrelevant, T=0? The guidelines: T=0 for evident misinformation, contradictions, or spammy/templated content. But irrelevant content might be T=0? The guidelines say T=0 for misinformation, contradictions, or spammy/templated content. But irrelevant content is not misinformation. But we can consider T=0 because it's not providing any relevant info. But maybe T=1? The passage is a generic description of CP types. It's not misinformation. But it's irrelevant to the query. The trustworthiness scoring is about the passage's credibility. The passage seems generic, no citations. So T=2? But the passage is not relevant.

So O stays 0. So final: {\"M\":0,\"T\":2,\"O\":0}. But maybe T=1? The passage is generic, no citations, but not misinformation. So T=1? The guidelines: 3: strong sourcing/authority, specific details, internally consistent. 2: generally credible text without clear sourcing issues. 1: vague claims, marketing fluff, noticeable hedging, or minor inconsistencies.

It only mentions types of cerebral palsy, not dysarthria. So the passage does not answer the query. So M=1? Wait M=1 is \"related: On the same topic/entity but does not answer the query (definitions/background/listings without the asked-for detail).\" The passage is about types of cerebral palsy, but the query is about types of dysarthria from cerebral palsy. Dysarthria is a speech disorder. The passage does not mention dysarthria. So it's related to cerebral palsy but not dysarthria. The query is specifically about dysarthria types. So the passage is not answering. So M=1? Or maybe M=0? Let's see: M=1 is \"On the same topic/entity but does not answer the query (definitions/background/listings without the asked-for detail).\" The passage is about types of cerebral palsy, which is a related entity but not dysarthria. The query is about dysarthria types. So the passage is not answering. It's not even about dysarthria. So it's not \"on the same topic/entity\"? The entity is dysarthria. The passage is about cerebral palsy. So it's not the same entity. So maybe M=0. But the passage is about cerebral palsy, which is related to dysarthria? Dysarthria can be a symptom of cerebral palsy. But the passage does not mention dysarthria. So it's not answering. So M=0.\n\nNow T: The passage has no citations, no author, no specificity beyond \"75%\". It's a simple statement. No sourcing. So T=1? The guidelines: T=3: strong sourcing/authority, specific details, internally consistent. T=2: generally credible text without clear sourcing issues. T=1: vague claims, marketing fluff, noticeable hedging, or minor inconsistencies. T=0: misinformation, contradictions, spam. The passage is simple, no citations, but not obviously misinformation. So T=2? It's generally credible text. There's no clear sourcing issues. So T=2.\n\nNow O: Start with O=M=0. If T=0 and passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1. Not relevant. If M=2 and T=3, increase O. Not the case. So O=0.\n\nThus output: [{\"M\":0,\"T\":2,\"O\":0}]."

But example shows a single object. They say \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows a single object. Might be a mistake. We should output a JSON array containing one object? Or just an object? The instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\"\n\nIt says \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows a single object. Maybe they want an array of objects? But \"array of scores\" could mean array of objects each with M,T,O. But we only have one passage. So array with one object. Let's output: [{\"M\": 2, \"T\": 2, \"O\": 2}]. But we need to decide the scores.\n\nWe need to evaluate the passage for the query: \"what are the social determinants of health\". The passage: \"Determinants of health are factors that contribute to a person's current state of health. These factors may be biological, socioeconomic, psychosocial, behavioral, or social in nature. Scientists generally recognize five determinants of health of a population [2, 3]: 1 Genes and biology: for example, sex and age.hese social determinants of health also interact with and influence individual behaviors as well. More specifically, social determinants of health refer to the set of factors that contribute to the social patterning of health, disease, and illness.\"\n\nThe passage does mention social determinants of health, but it's incomplete: \"Scientists generally recognize five determinants of health of a population [2, 3]: 1 Genes and biology: for example, sex and age.hese social determinants of health also interact with and influence individual behaviors as well.\" It seems truncated. It doesn't list all five determinants. It mentions social determinants but not enumerated. The query: \"what are the social determinants of health\". The passage partially answers: it says social determinants of health refer to set of factors that contribute to social patterning of health, disease, and illness. But it doesn't list them. So it's partially relevant but incomplete. So M=2? Let's see: M=2 (highly relevant) because it contains correct answer but incomplete. T: The passage has citations [2,3] but no author info. It's somewhat credible but not strongly sourced. So T=2. O: M=2, T=2, no reduction. So O=2. So output: {\"M\":2,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}. But they want JSON array. So maybe [{\"M\":2,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}].

We need to evaluate M, T, O.\n\nFirst, interpret query: \"what is the most popular food in switzerland\". Likely informational. The passage says: \"Historically, Switzerland was a farming country, and the most popular crops and foods include cheese and potatoes as well as chocolate.\" So it states that the most popular crops and foods include cheese, potatoes, chocolate. That addresses the query: \"most popular food in Switzerland\". It gives a list. So M=3? Let's see: The passage directly answers the query: \"most popular crops and foods include cheese and potatoes as well as chocolate.\" That is a direct answer. So M=3.\n\nNow T: Evaluate trustworthiness. The passage has no citations, no author, no date. It's a short paragraph. It seems like a general statement. No clear sourcing. But it's not obviously misinformation. It's plausible. So T=2? The guidelines: 3: strong sourcing/authority, specific details, internally consistent. 2: generally credible text without clear sourcing issues. 1: vague claims, marketing fluff, hedging. 0: misinformation. The passage is fairly specific: \"cheese and potatoes as well as chocolate.\" It's consistent. No contradictions. So T=2.\n\nNow O: Start with O=M=3. If T=0 and passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1. Not the case. If M=2 and T=3, increase O. Not the case. So O=3.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}. But the instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\"\n\nWait: They want a JSON array of scores? The example shows a single JSON object. But they say \"JSON array of scores\". Might mean an array of objects? But the example shows a single object. The instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\"\n\nIt seems they want a JSON object. The example shows a single object.

So M=1 (related). T: The passage is a short statement, no citations, but not obviously marketing fluff. It's a factual claim about lanolin. It's somewhat credible but no source. So T=2?

Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\"\n\nSo we output something like [{\"M\":..., \"T\":..., \"O\":...}]. The passage: \"Theraderm is a manufacturer of clinical-grade skin care products, including anti-aging creams and moisturizers, as well as an acne system under an alternate brand: Reversion. The company was founded in 1996 by James Beckman, M.D., and is headquartered in Springdale, Arkansas.\"\n\nQuery: \"what is theraderm used for\"\n\nWe need to judge intent: informational. The passage gives that Theraderm is a manufacturer of clinical-grade skin care products, including anti-aging creams and moisturizers, and an acne system under alternate brand. So it answers \"what is Theraderm used for\" by describing product types. So M=3? It's directly relevant, focused answer. There's no noise. So M=3.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage gives specific details: manufacturer, product types, brand, founder, location. No citations but it's specific. It's likely credible. So T=2? The passage is not citing sources but it's specific. According to guidelines: 3: strong sourcing/authority, specific details, internally consistent. 2: generally credible text without clear sourcing issues. 1: vague claims, marketing fluff. This is specific but no citations. So T=2.\n\nOverall: Start with O=M=3. T=2, M=3, no special rule. So O=3.\n\nThus output: [{\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}]."

    "prompt": "Judge only from the provided passage (don’t use outside knowledge).\nConsider common query intents (informational, navigational, transactional). If ambiguous, pick the most probable informational intent.\nIf the query contains quotes, treat it as a request for those exact terms.\nIgnore images/links unless described in the passage text.\nIf the passage is metadata-only (e.g., boilerplate, cookie banners), treat as non-answering.\n\nDo not stray from the given parameters at any point. \nLabel every single document, do not leave anything blank.\nAssume that you are writing a report on the subject of the topic. \nA person has typed \"what is theraderm used for\" into a search engine.\nConsider the following passage: Incoming search phrases: what do celebrities use to bleach their skin, what do celebrities use to whiten their skin, what do celebrities use to lighten their skin, what are celebrities using to bleach their skin, what are celebrities using to whiten their skin, what are celebrities using to lighten their skin, do celebrities use whitening creams, do celebrities use bleaching creams, do celebrities use lightening creams\nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search. \n\nFor match (M):\n3 (perfectly relevant): Direct, focused answer or uniquely on-topic content; answers the query clearly and fully (for the likely intent).\n2 (highly relevant): Contains a correct/usable answer but surrounded by noise, partially complete, or requires minor inference.\n1 (related): On the same topic/entity but does not answer the query (definitions/background/listings without the asked-for detail).\n0 (irrelevant): Off-topic, contradictory to the query, or purely boilerplate.\n\nFor trustworthiness (T):\nConsider sourcing signals visible in the passage (citations, author/affiliation, specificity, internal consistency, datedness if stated).\n3: Strong sourcing/authority, specific details, internally consistent.\n2: Generally credible text without clear sourcing issues.\n1: Vague claims, marketing fluff, noticeable hedging, or minor inconsistencies.\n0: Evident misinformation, contradictions, or spammy/templated content.\n\nFor overall (O):\nStart with O = M.\nIf T = 0 and the passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1 (floor at 0).\nIf M = 2 and T = 3 (highly credible) and the answer is only slightly obscured, you may increase O to 3.\nOtherwise, keep O = M.\nClamp to 0–3.\n\nAlso consider these edge cases:\nMultiple intents: If the passage satisfies one plausible high-frequency intent for the query, score against that; don’t average intents.\nNegations/opposites: If the passage addresses the opposite of what’s asked (e.g., “how not to …” vs “how to …”), likely M=1 unless it still directly answers.\nLists/tables: If the exact requested item/data point is present, consider M≥2; if the category is right but the item is missing, M=1.\nComparisons: If the query asks “best X” and the passage ranks/compares X with rationale including the requested X, M≥2; generic sales copy without comparison is M=1.\n\nStrictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}",

It's metadata only. The user query: \"what is theraderm used for\". The passage does not mention Theraderm. So it's irrelevant. According to instructions: If passage is metadata-only, treat as non-answering. So M=0. T? It's irrelevant content, no sourcing. T=0? The passage is just a list of search phrases. No claims. So T=0. O? Start with O=M=0. If T=0 and passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1 but floor at 0. So O remains 0. So output JSON array: {\"M\":0,\"T\":0,\"O\":0}."
