Right ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in right ventricular workload, e.g., emphysema or pulmonary embolization.

RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers. Based on this principle, the RSA encryption algorithm uses prime factorization as the trap door for encryption. Deducing an RSA key, therefore, takes a huge amount of time and processing power. RSA is the standard encryption method for important data, especially data that's transmitted over the Internet.\nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search.
