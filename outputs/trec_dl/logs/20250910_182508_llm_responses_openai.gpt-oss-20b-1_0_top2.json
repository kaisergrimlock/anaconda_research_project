The price differences between a McDonald’s Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\"\n\nWe need to score M, T, O. M: relevance to query. The passage mentions McDouble and Double Cheeseburger, but it's about price differences, not the difference in composition. The query asks difference between a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger. The passage does mention both, but only in context of price differences. It does not answer the difference in ingredients. So it's partially relevant but not fully. According to guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. This is somewhat related but not answering. So M=1.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage is a review, presumably from a website. It's a review of Triple Cheeseburger, but mentions price differences. It's likely trustworthy? It's a review, but not necessarily authoritative. But it's a review, not a fact-check. The passage is not obviously unreliable. So T=2? But guidelines: trustworthiness: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. We need to evaluate trustworthiness. The passage is a review, but not necessarily authoritative. But it's not obviously false. I'd give T=2.\n\nOverall score O: combine M and T. Usually O is some function. But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" but no explicit formula. We can maybe average or choose the lower? Usually overall is a combined measure. I'd choose 1? But maybe 2? Let's think: M=1, T=2. Overall maybe 1? But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" but no formula. We can maybe take the minimum? Or average? The example didn't show. But typical approach: overall is a weighted average. But we can choose 1.5? But must be integer 0-3. I'd choose 1. Because relevance is low. So O=1.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}."

But guidelines: overall score is not defined but likely combine M and T. We can choose 1? But we need to decide. The overall score should reflect both. I'd give O: 1? But maybe 2? Let's think: M=1, T=2. Overall maybe 1? But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" but no explicit formula. We can choose something like average of M and T? That would be (1+2)/2=1.5, round?
