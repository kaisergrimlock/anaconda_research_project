In the lungs, blood is mixed with oxygen and then pumped back to the left ventricle to be eventually distributed to the brain and to other parts of the body.

Some species live mainly in cold waters, while some others prefer warmer waters. SHARK MIGRATION. One thing is for sure; sharks migrate to find new sources of food and they can travel up to hundreds of miles to do that. Most species of sharks live in the oceans. However, some of them are known to dwell in bodies of freshwater, like the bull shark which travels up to 4,000 Km up the Amazon River. Sometimes, sharks reach freshwater bodies; this could be the result of the destruction of their habitat by human activities.  \nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search.

It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.  \nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search.

RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers. Based on this principle, the RSA encryption algorithm uses prime factorization as the trap door for encryption. Deducing an RSA key, therefore, takes a huge amount of time and processing power. RSA is the standard encryption method for important data, especially data that's transmitted over the Internet.  \nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search.
