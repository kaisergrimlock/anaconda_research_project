So it is relevant. It might not give exact cost but gives average prices. So it's highly relevant. So M=2. Trustworthiness? It's not clear if it's trustworthy. It's generic description, maybe from a website. We can assign T=2? Or maybe 1? The passage seems like marketing copy. Might be somewhat trustworthy but not authoritative. I'd give T=2. Then O=2?
