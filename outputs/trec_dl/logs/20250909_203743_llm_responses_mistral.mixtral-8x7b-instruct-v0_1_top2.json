Description, Causes and Risk Factors: Abbreviation: RVH. Right ventricular hypertrophy is the increase or the enlargement in the size of the right ventricle of the heart. The right ventricle is responsible for pumping blood towards the lungs. In the lungs, blood is mixed with oxygen and then pumped back to the left ventricle to be eventually distributed to the awefvjxshazctnusrnvcfsipmoluishgdfdoue brain and to other parts of the body. There are several possible causes of right ventricular hypertrophy.\nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search.
