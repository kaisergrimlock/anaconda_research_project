The passage contains cost of interior concrete flooring: $92 per yard for 3000 psi. So it's relevant. It's not exactly the answer? The query: \"cost of interior concrete flooring\". The passage gives cost per yard. That is the answer. So M=3.\n\nT: Trustworthiness. It's a company statement. It's presumably trustworthy? It's a direct statement of cost. But we don't know if it's accurate. But it's a primary source. I'd give 2 maybe. But guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. For trustworthiness, we need to evaluate if the passage is trustworthy. It's a company statement. It's likely trustworthy. I'd give 2. But maybe 3? The passage is a direct statement of cost. It's likely accurate. But we can't guarantee. I'd give 2.\n\nO: Overall score. Usually average or something. But we need to produce a single integer. We can compute average of M and T? But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\". We need to decide. Usually O is maybe average of M and T. But we can decide. Let's compute (3+2)/2 = 2.5, round? But integer. We can round to nearest integer: 3? Or floor? Not specified. But we can choose 3? But maybe 2.5 -> 3? But we can choose 3. But maybe we should choose 3?

The difference between an RN and a BSN is that an RN is a title for a registered nurse, while a BSN stands for a Bachelor of Science in nursing. Learn about the differences between degrees and licenses with help from a licensed RN in this free video on nursing jobs and health care.\"\n\nQuery: \"difference between rn and bsn\"\n\nWe need to score:\n\nIntent match M: The passage directly addresses the difference between RN and BSN. It says \"The difference between an RN and a BSN is that an RN is a title for a registered nurse, while a BSN stands for a Bachelor of Science in nursing.\" That is a direct answer. So M=3.\n\nTrustworthiness T: The passage seems to be from some source, but we don't know. It says \"Learn about the differences between degrees and licenses with help from a licensed RN in this free video on nursing jobs and health care.\" It's not obviously authoritative. But it's not obviously false. It's a general statement. We can assign T=2 maybe. But guidelines: 3 perfect trustworthiness, 2 highly trustworthy, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. The passage is likely trustworthy but not necessarily authoritative. I'd give T=2.\n\nOverall O: combine M and T. Usually O is overall score. We can average or something. But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" but no explicit formula. We can consider O as average of M and T? Or maybe we choose the lower of M and T? But typical approach: O = (M+T)/2? But we need integer 0-3. Let's compute average: (3+2)/2 = 2.5 -> round? We could round to nearest integer: 3? Or floor: 2. But guidelines don't specify. We can choose O=3? But that might be too high. Let's think: The passage is highly relevant and somewhat trustworthy. So overall maybe 3? But if we consider trustworthiness moderate, overall maybe 3? The guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" but no formula. We can decide to use the higher of M and T? That would be 3. But maybe we should use the lower? That would be 2. But the passage is perfect for intent, so overall should be high. I'd set O=3.\n\nBut we need to be consistent. Let's check guidelines: \"Adhere strictly to the scoring guidelines: 3: Perfectly relevant. The passage is dedicated to the query and contains the exact answer.\" That is M. For T: \"3: Perfectly trustworthy.\" The passage is not obviously perfect. So T=2. For O: \"overall score.\" We can maybe average. But we need to produce integer. Let's average and round down: floor((3+2)/2)=2. But that seems low. But maybe we should use the higher? But guidelines don't specify. Let's think: The passage is perfect for intent, but trustworthiness is moderate. So overall maybe 3? But if we consider overall as combined, maybe 3? But if we consider overall as \"overall relevance and trustworthiness\" maybe we should take the lower? But that would be 2. But the passage is perfect for intent, so overall should reflect that. I'd choose O=3.\n\nBut we need to decide. Let's read the instructions: \"For each given query and its associated passages, assign scores on an integer scale from 0 to 3 for measures of intent match (M), trustworthiness (T), and overall score (O).\" So we need to assign each. There's no formula. So we can choose O based on our judgment. I'd set O=3 because it's perfect for intent and fairly trustworthy.\n\nThus output: [{\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}]\n\nBut we need to output JSON array? The instruction: \"Output array length and order must match the input `passages` array.\" So we output an array of objects. So final output: [{\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}]\n\nLet's produce that."

Post to Facebook.\"\n\nWe need to score M (intent match), T (trustworthiness), O (overall). The passage is about suicide being leading cause of death, but does not list causes of military suicide. It mentions that suicide surpassed war as leading cause. It doesn't answer causes. So it's related but not answering. So M=1. Trustworthiness: unclear source, mentions bar chart published this week in a. Post to Facebook. Not reliable. So T=1 maybe. Overall: combine. Likely 1. So output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}."
