The fancy goldfish do not get as large as the common/comet/shubunkin/feeder goldfish.

The query: \"do goldfish grow\" - answer: yes, they grow, but size depends on tank. The passage provides that. So M (match) high: 3. T (trustworthiness) unknown; but it's likely from a fish care website. We don't have source. But we can guess moderate trust: 2. O final: maybe 3? But we need to consider relative importance.

It says \"Ventricular hypertrophy can be part of various syndromes caused by any of various underlying diseases.\" That is vague. So the passage partially addresses the query but not directly. So M (match) maybe 2 (highly relevant). T (trustworthiness) unknown; but it's a generic passage, maybe 3? But we don't have source. Could be 2. But we need to decide. The instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" We don't know. But we can guess moderate trustworthiness. So maybe T=2. Then O (overall) maybe 2. So output: {\"M\": 2, \"T\": 2, \"O\": 2}. But the example says \"Results {}\" maybe they want an array? The instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\"\n\nIt says \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows an object.
