It's a business advertisement. Trustworthiness: It's a primary source, but it's a commercial. Might be somewhat trustworthy for cost. But we can give T=2 maybe. M=3 because it directly answers cost. O maybe average of M and T? But guidelines: overall score O is presumably overall relevance and trustworthiness. We can set O=2 or 3? The passage is relevant and somewhat trustworthy. I'd give O=2.5?

The price differences between a McDonald’s Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\"\n\nWe need to score M, T, O. M: relevance to query. The passage mentions McDouble and Double Cheeseburger, but it's about price differences, not the difference in composition. The query asks difference between a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger. The passage does mention both, but only in context of price differences. It does not answer the difference in ingredients. So it's partially relevant but not fully. According to guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. This is somewhat related but not answering. So M=1.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage is a review, presumably from a website. It's not a primary source but could be considered somewhat trustworthy. But it's not authoritative. I'd give T=2? But guidelines: 3 perfect trustworthiness, 2 highly trustworthy, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. The passage is a review, not necessarily authoritative. But it's likely from a reputable site? Hard to know. I'd give T=2? But maybe 1? The passage is not a direct source of difference. It's a review, but it might be trustworthy. I'd lean T=2.\n\nOverall score O: combine M and T. If M=1, T=2, overall maybe 1? The guidelines don't specify formula. Usually overall is average or something. But we can choose 1.5? But must be integer 0-3. I'd choose 1. Because M is low.

It says they grow to depth of water, stunted if tank too small. So it answers the query. So M=3. T: trustworthiness. The passage seems factual, but no source. It's general knowledge. I'd give T=2 maybe. But guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. Trustworthiness: we don't have source, but it's plausible. I'd give T=2. O: overall score: maybe average or weighted? Probably combine M and T. Since M=3, T=2, overall maybe 3? But guidelines: overall score is a single integer. We need to decide. Usually overall is maybe average of M and T? But not specified. We can choose 3? But if trustworthiness lower, overall maybe 2.5? But must be integer. I'd choose 3? But maybe 2. Let's think: The passage is relevant and somewhat trustworthy. I'd give overall 3? But trustworthiness is not perfect. I'd give overall 3? The guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" but no explicit formula. I'd choose 3? But maybe 2. Let's decide: M=3, T=2, O=3? But that seems inconsistent. Maybe O=2? Let's choose O=3? The passage is relevant and fairly trustworthy. I'd give O=3. But trustworthiness 2 indicates some uncertainty. But overall maybe 3? The user query: \"do goldfish grow\". The passage answers yes. So overall 3. I'll output: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}."

M: intent match. The passage addresses goldfish growth, yes. It says they grow, but growth depends on tank size. It answers the query \"do goldfish grow?\" Yes, it says they do grow, but growth can be stunted. So it's relevant. Score 2? It's highly relevant. It contains answer but also extra info. So M=2.\n\nT: trustworthiness. The passage seems factual but no source. It's general knowledge. Might be moderately trustworthy. Score 2? Could be 2. O: overall score: maybe average of M and T? But guidelines: overall score is a combined measure. Likely 2. So output: {\"M\":2,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}.\n\nWe need to output array of objects? The instruction: Output array length and order must match input passages array. There's only one passage. So output array with one object. But example shows just object. Wait: \"Output array length and order must match the input passages array.\" So if multiple passages, output array of objects. For single passage, output array with one object. But example shows just object? The example: Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}. That example is ambiguous. But instruction says output array length and order must match input passages array. So we should output an array of objects. But the example shows just object. However, the example might be incomplete. The instruction: \"Output array length and order must match the input passages array.\" So we should output array. So for one passage, output: [{\"M\":2,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}]. But the example shows just object. But the example might be placeholder. The instruction earlier: \"Output: A json object with the format: { \"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score }\". That suggests single object. But then \"Output array length and order must match the input passages array.\" Contradiction. Which to follow? The instruction hierarchy: The earlier bullet says \"Output: A json object with the format: { \"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score }\". Then later says \"Output array length and order must match the input passages array.\" So likely they want an array of objects. But the example shows just object. The example might be incomplete. But the instruction says \"Output array length and order must match the input passages array.\" So we should output array.

Synaptic knobs are located at the tip of each axon terminal.\"\n\nWe need to score:\n\nM: Intent match. The passage directly addresses the definition of synaptic knobs, which are the rounded areas on axon terminals. The query is \"axon terminals or synaptic knob definition\". The passage provides the definition. So M=3.\n\nT: Trustworthiness. The passage seems like a quiz question with answer. It's not a source but it's a correct answer. It's likely trustworthy. But we don't have source. But it's a factual statement. I'd give T=2 maybe. But guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. Trustworthiness: we need to evaluate trustworthiness. The passage is a quiz question, but the answer is correct. I'd give T=2.\n\nO: Overall score: combine M and T. Usually O is maybe average or something. But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" but no explicit formula. We can maybe average M and T. M=3, T=2 => average 2.5 => round? But integer 0-3. We could choose 3? But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" maybe we can choose 3 if both high. But we need to decide. Let's think: M=3, T=2. Overall maybe 3? But maybe 2? The passage is highly relevant and somewhat trustworthy. I'd give O=3? But maybe 2.5 round to 3? But we need integer. I'd choose 3? But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" maybe we can compute as average and round to nearest integer. 2.5 rounds to 3. So O=3.\n\nThus output: [{\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}]."

                  "text": "We need to evaluate the passage. Query: \"causes of military suicide\". Passage: \"Suicide surpassed war as the military's leading cause of death. War was the leading cause of death in the military nearly every year between 2004 and 2011 until suicides became the top means dying for in 2012 and 2013, according to a bar chart published this week in a. Post to Facebook.\"\n\nWe need to score M (intent match), T (trustworthiness), O (overall). The passage mentions that suicide surpassed war as leading cause of death, but does not list causes of military suicide. The query is \"causes of military suicide\". The passage does not provide causes, just a statistic. So it's related but not answering. So M=1. Trustworthiness: It's referencing a bar chart published this week in a. Post to Facebook. That seems not very trustworthy. It's a social media post. So T=1 maybe. Overall: combine M and T. Since M=1, T=1, overall maybe 1. So output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}."
