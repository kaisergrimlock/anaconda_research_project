The passage contains the exact answer: cost per yard. The query: cost of interior concrete flooring. The passage gives cost per yard. That is answer. So M=3. Trustworthiness: It's a company statement, not necessarily verified. But it's a direct quote. Could be considered somewhat trustworthy but not verified. Score T: maybe 2?

The passage gives cost per yard for interior floors. So it's a direct answer. So M=3.\n\nT: Trustworthiness. It's a company statement. It's presumably trustworthy? It's a direct quote from a company. There's no source verification. But it's likely trustworthy. But we can give 2 or 3. The guidelines: 3: Perfectly relevant.

Let's decide: M=3, T=2, O=3? But that seems inconsistent. Maybe O should be the higher of M and T? Or the average? The guidelines don't specify. But typical evaluation: overall is a combined measure. I'd give 3? But if trustworthiness is 2, overall might be 2.5 but we need integer. I'd round down to 2. So O=2. But the passage is quite relevant. But trustworthiness is not perfect. So overall 2. I'd choose O=3? Let's think: The passage is a direct cost. It's likely trustworthy. I'd give T=3. Then O=3. That seems plausible. The passage is from a company, but it's a direct statement. I'd say trustworthiness is high. So T=3. Then O=3. That seems consistent. So final: M=3, T=3, O=3.\n\nThus output: [{\"M\":3,\"T\":3,\"O\":3}]."

The passage is about ecological anthropology and environment influence. The query is anthropological definition of environment. The passage does not give a definition, but mentions environment influence. It's somewhat related but not a definition. So M maybe 1 (related). T: trustworthiness. The passage seems like a snippet from a text, but no source. It's likely not highly trustworthy. But it's a factual statement. I'd give T=2? But guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. For trustworthiness, we need to assess if the passage is trustworthy. It's a generic statement, but no source. I'd give T=2? But maybe 1? The passage is not obviously from a reputable source. But it's a factual statement. I'd lean T=2? But trustworthiness is separate from relevance. I'd give T=2.

But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" but no formula. We can choose to set O equal to M? But maybe we should set O = M? But we can set O = M? But we can also set O = (M+T)/2 rounded? Let's think. The example didn't show O calculation. But we can set O = M? But that would ignore trustworthiness. But maybe O is overall relevance and trustworthiness. I'd set O = (M+T)/2 rounded down? For M=1, T=2, average=1.5 => round down to 1? Or round to nearest integer? 1.5 => 2? Not sure. But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" but no formula. We can set O = M? But that would ignore trustworthiness. But maybe O = M? But the example didn't show. Let's read the instructions: \"For each given query and its associated passages, assign scores on an integer scale from 0 to 3 for measures of intent match (M), trustworthiness (T), and overall score (O).\" So we need to assign O. We can decide O as a combined measure. I'd set O = (M+T)/2 rounded to nearest integer. So (1+2)/2=1.5 => round to 2. So O=2. That seems reasonable: overall moderately relevant and somewhat trustworthy. So final JSON array: one object: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}."

M: The passage mentions suicide as leading cause of death, but does not list causes. The query is \"causes of military suicide\". The passage does not provide causes, just that suicide surpassed war. So it's related but not answering. So M=1.\n\nT: Trustworthiness: It's a snippet referencing a bar chart published this week. No source. Might be from a reputable source? Hard to judge. Likely moderate trustworthiness? But we have no evidence. I'd give T=2? But guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. Trustworthiness: we don't know. I'd give 2? But maybe 1? The passage is not obviously from a reputable source. But it's a factual statement. I'd give T=2? But trustworthiness is separate from relevance. I'd give T=2? But maybe 1? Let's think: The passage is a snippet from a news article? It says \"according to a bar chart published this week in a.\" incomplete. So uncertain. I'd give T=1? But trustworthiness: It's a factual claim but no source. I'd lean 1.\n\nO: overall: combine M and T. M=1, T=1 => O=1? But guidelines: overall score likely average? But we can just assign O=1. Let's do that.\n\nReturn JSON array: [{\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}]."

The passage is dedicated to the query and contains the exact answer.\n- 2: Highly relevant. The passage contains some answer, but it may be unclear or mixed with extraneous information.\n- 1: Related. The passage is on-topic but does not answer the query.\n- 0: Irrelevant. The passage is not related to the query.\n- Evaluate every single passage; do not leave any items unscored or blank.\n- Always assume you are preparing a report based on the topic from the query.\n- Consider the user's intent as expressed by their search and methodically assess each passage.\n- Input Parameters:\n- `query`: A non-empty string representing the user's search query.\n- `passages`: An array of non-empty strings, with each string as a passage to be evaluated.\n- Output:\n- JSON array of objects, each corresponding to a passage (order preserved).\n- Each object format: { \"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score } where each score is an integer from 0 to 3.\nA person has typed \"causes of military suicide\" into a search engine.\nConsider the following passage: Suicide surpassed war as the military's leading cause of death.
