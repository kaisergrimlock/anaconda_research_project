In the lungs, blood is mixed with oxygen and causes of left ventricular hypertrophy then pumped back to the left ventricle to be eventually distributed to the brain and to other parts of the body. There are several possible causes of right ventricular hypertrophy.\nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search.
