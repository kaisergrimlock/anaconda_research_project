The examples: For a perfect definition, they gave M=3, T=3, O=3. For a partial but still relevant, they gave M=2, T=2, O=2. So if M=3 but T=2, maybe O=2? But maybe O should be the minimum of M and T?

They want {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score}. So produce that.\n\nWe need to evaluate the passage for query \"causes of left ventricular hypertrophy\". Passage: \"Chamber Hypertrophy and Enlargment. In hypertrophy the heart muscle becomes thicker. This can have different causes. Left ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in left ventricular workload, e.g., during hypertension or aortic valve stenosis. Right ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in right ventricular workload, e.g., emphysema or pulmonary embolization. These causes are fundamentally different from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is a congenital misalignment of cardiomyocytes, resulting in hypertrophy.\"\n\nWe need to assess M: match to query. The passage does mention causes: hypertension, aortic valve stenosis. So it does answer. It's somewhat concise but includes answer. So M=2? The example for similar passage had M=2. That example had \"By Mayo Clinic Staff...\" and included hypertension. That got M=2. This passage also includes hypertension and aortic valve stenosis. So M=2.\n\nT: trustworthiness. The passage seems generic, not citing source. Might be less trustworthy. But still likely moderate. In example, the Mayo Clinic passage got T=2. This passage is less authoritative. Might be T=1? But we need to decide. The passage is not from a known source. It's generic. So maybe T=1. But the example for \"anthropological definition of environment\" had T=3 for a correct definition. That passage was presumably from a dictionary. The second example had T=0. So trustworthiness is about source credibility. This passage is generic, no source. I'd give T=1.\n\nO: overall. Combine M and T. M=2, T=1. So overall maybe 1? But the example for M=2, T=2 gave O=2. If T lower, maybe O=1. So O=1.\n\nThus output: {\"M\": 2, \"T\": 1, \"O\": 1}"

The passage mentions average prices and cost of concrete flooring. So it's relevant. The query is \"cost of interior concrete flooring\". The passage addresses cost, average prices, design features that contribute to cost. So M likely 3. T: trustworthiness. The passage seems generic, maybe from a website. No obvious source. But it's likely a typical content page. We can assign T maybe 2? But trustworthiness: no source, but it's not obviously false. I'd give T=2. O: overall. M=3, T=2 => O maybe 2? But if M high, T moderate, overall maybe 2. But could be 3 if trustworthiness is okay. The passage is fairly straightforward. I'd give O=2. So final JSON: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}."

It's a company page, but not necessarily authoritative. I'd give T=2. O: final score: maybe 3? But if T=2, O might be 2? The examples: For query \"causes of left ventricular hypertrophy\", passage from Mayo Clinic Staff, M=2, T=2, O=2. But that passage had some answer but not exact? It had some answer. For our passage, it's exact answer. So M=3. T maybe 2. O maybe 3? But if T=2, maybe O=2? The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O is final. If M=3, T=2, maybe O=3? But trustworthiness matters. But the passage is from a company, but it's giving cost. I'd lean O=3 because it's highly relevant and answer is clear. But trustworthiness is moderate. But the final score might be 3. Let's see examples: For \"anthropological definition of environment\", passage from a dictionary, M=3, T=3, O=3. For \"causes of left ventricular hypertrophy\", passage from Mayo Clinic, M=2, T=2, O=2. So if M=3, T=2, maybe O=3? But maybe O=2? The guidelines: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So if M=3 but T=2, maybe O=3? But trustworthiness is less important? Hard to say. I'd give O=3. So final JSON: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}."

It's a review of Triple Cheeseburger from McDonald's. It's likely a review site, maybe not authoritative. But it's about McDonald's burgers. Could be somewhat trustworthy. But we can assign T=2? The passage is from a review, but it's about McDonald's. It's not a medical or official source. But it's about price differences. I'd say T=2 (some trust). O: overall.

The passage does mention McDouble and double cheeseburger, and describes difference: McDouble has two patties with one slice of cheese, double cheeseburger has two patties with two slices of cheese. So it directly answers difference. So M=3.\n\nT: trustworthiness of web page. We don't have info. The passage seems like a snippet from a website. We can't judge trustworthiness. In examples, they set T=3 for authoritative source like Mayo Clinic. For generic snippet, maybe T=2? But we don't know. The passage is likely from a blog or article. We can guess moderate trustworthiness. So T=2.\n\nO: overall score: combine M and T. M=3, T=2. Likely O=2 or 3? The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O should reflect both. Since M high, T moderate, O maybe 2.5? But must be integer 0-3.

With all else equal, RNs with BSN degrees receive higher salaries than those with ASN or ADN degrees. ... RN versus BSN Salary Based on Experience.\" So it's highly relevant. The passage contains the answer: difference in salary. So M=3. Trustworthiness: The passage cites Indeed website, but not BLS. It's a general statement. It's somewhat trustworthy but not authoritative. But it's likely from a website. We can assign T=2. O=3? The final score O should consider both M and T. Since M=3, T=2, O likely 3? The examples: For a perfect answer, M=3, T=3, O=3. For a good answer but not perfect, maybe M=2, T=2, O=2. Here M=3, T=2. So O maybe 3? But the instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).

Let's think: The passage is relevant and contains answer. So M=3. Trustworthiness moderate: T=2. O maybe 3? But if trustworthiness is lower, maybe O=2. The examples: For \"causes of left ventricular hypertrophy\" passage from Mayo Clinic Staff, M=2, T=2, O=2. That passage is from Mayo Clinic, so trustworthiness high. But M=2 because maybe not fully answering? They gave some causes. So O=2. For perfect answer, M=3, T=3, O=3. So O seems to be min of M and T? But not exactly. For the first example, M=3, T=3, O=3. For second example, M=0, T=0, O=0. For third example, M=2, T=2, O=2. So O equals M and T. So maybe O = min(M,T). But if M=3, T=2, O=2. That seems plausible. So we should output O=2.

The passage mentions that goldfish will quickly grow too big for a fish bowl. So it addresses growth. So M (match) is high. The passage is relevant. The answer: yes, goldfish grow. So M=3. Trustworthiness: The passage is from some website? It's not obviously authoritative. But it's a statement. We can assign T=2 maybe. But the passage is not a scientific source. But it's a statement. So T=2. O final: maybe 2 or 3? The passage is relevant but not authoritative. So O=2. But the passage does answer the query: \"do goldfish grow?\" It says they will quickly grow too big. So it's a direct answer. So maybe O=3. But trustworthiness is lower. The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search.

The passage says goldfish grow with environment, can keep growing if large space and fed enough. So it answers the question. It's somewhat relevant. The passage is somewhat trustworthy? It's not from a known source, but it's plausible. So M=3, T=2? But the passage is not authoritative. But it's a direct answer. So M=3. T maybe 2 because not a reputable source. O maybe 3? The overall score is likely 3. But we need to consider trustworthiness. The passage is not from a known source, but it's a statement. The question is simple: do goldfish grow? The passage says yes. So M=3. T maybe 2. O maybe 3? But the instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O is final. We need to decide O. If M=3, T=2, O maybe 3? But if trustworthiness is lower, maybe O=2. But the passage is fairly straightforward. I'd lean O=3 because it directly answers. But trustworthiness is moderate. The examples: For left ventricular hypertrophy, passage from Mayo Clinic, M=2, T=2, O=2. That passage is authoritative but not perfect. For anthropological definition, passage is perfect, M=3, T=3, O=3. For irrelevant passage, all zeros. So if M=3 but T=2, maybe O=2? But the passage is not authoritative but still correct. The question is simple. I'd give O=3? But maybe they want O=2 because trustworthiness matters. The passage is not from a known source. But the question is \"do goldfish grow?\" The passage says yes. So it's highly relevant. I'd give M=3, T=2, O=3. But maybe O=2? Let's think: The passage is not from a reputable source, but it's a statement. The question is simple. The passage is relevant. I'd give O=3. The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" The relative importance: M is likely more important than T.

In examples, they gave 3 for a passage that is directly relevant and presumably trustworthy. For the left ventricular hypertrophy example, they gave 2 for M, T, O. That passage was from Mayo Clinic Staff, presumably trustworthy. They gave 2. So maybe 2 is typical. But we can consider that the passage is factual but we don't know source. I'd give 2.\n\nO: final score: likely 2 or 3. Since M=3, T=2, O maybe 2.5? But must be integer 0-3. We need to decide. The passage is relevant and contains answer. So O maybe 3.

The passage states that Legionella pneumophila is among bacteria that can cause pneumonia. So it directly answers the query. So M=3. Trustworthiness: The passage seems like a generic statement, but not obviously from a reputable source. But it's a factual statement. We can assign T=2 maybe.

So maybe M=2 for highly relevant. But the passage is a direct answer. But they gave 2. So maybe M=2 for highly relevant. But the example for \"anthropological definition of environment\" had a passage that directly defined environment. They gave M=3. So difference: The passage for left ventricular hypertrophy had a source \"By Mayo Clinic Staff.\" But they gave M=2. Why? Maybe because the passage is not exactly answering the query? The query: \"causes of left ventricular hypertrophy\". The passage: \"Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body. Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension\". That is indeed a direct answer. But they gave M=2. So maybe they consider that the passage is not perfect because it only lists one cause, not all. So it's highly relevant but not perfect. So M=2. For our passage, it lists Legionella pneumophila as a cause. That is a direct answer. But maybe it's also not perfect because it repeats. But it's still a direct answer. So M=2? But the example for anthropological definition had M=3. That passage was exactly the definition. So maybe M=3 for perfect answer. Our passage is a list of bacteria that cause pneumonia, including Legionella. That is a perfect answer? It directly answers the query. So M=3. Trustworthiness: The passage is generic, no source. So T=2. O maybe 2 or 3? The overall score O is based on M and T. If M=3 and T=2, maybe O=2? But the example for left ventricular hypertrophy had M=2, T=2, O=2. So O equals M and T? They seem to set O equal to M and T. For anthropological definition, M=3, T=3, O=3. For left ventricular hypertrophy, M=2, T=2, O=2. So O equals M and T. So we should set O equal to M and T. So if we set M=3, T=2, O=2? But that would be inconsistent: O should equal M and T? But they didn't say O must equal M and T.

So T=2.\n\nO: overall. Weighted. Likely 3? But trustworthiness lower. But overall still relevant. I'd give O=2? But examples: For left ventricular hypertrophy, passage from Mayo Clinic Staff, they gave M=2, T=2, O=2. That passage had some answer but not exact? It had explanation. For our passage, it's more direct. So maybe O=3. But trustworthiness lower. But overall maybe 3? The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O is final. If M=3, T=2, maybe O=3? But maybe O=2.5? But must be integer 0-3.

The query is \"how to find the midsegment\". The passage partially answers: it says it's the segment connecting midpoints of legs. But does not give method to find midpoints. So it's somewhat relevant but incomplete. According to scoring: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. This is likely 2: it has some answer but not full. Trustworthiness: it's a generic geometry description, likely trustworthy. So T=3? But maybe 2. The passage is likely from a geometry textbook, so trustworthiness high. So T=3. M=2. O=2? Or maybe O=2. The example for left ventricular hypertrophy had M=2, T=2, O=2. But that passage had a clear answer. Here it's partial. I'd give M=2, T=3, O=2. But maybe T=2 because it's not a source. But it's a generic definition. I'd lean T=3. So final JSON: {\"M\":2,\"T\":3,\"O\":2}."

But the passage is fairly straightforward. I'd say trustworthiness moderate. So T=2. M=3. O maybe 3? But if trustworthiness is not perfect, maybe O=2. The examples: For the left ventricular hypertrophy example, M=2, T=2, O=2. So O equals M and T if they are same. For the anthropological definition, M=3, T=3, O=3. So O seems to be the same as M and T if they match. But if they differ, maybe O is the lower?

It does not provide definition. So M likely 1 (related but not answer). T: trustworthiness of web page. We don't know source. The passage seems like excerpt from a report. Might be trustworthy? But we can't assume. Probably moderate trust. But we need to score T. The passage is from a presumably official Medicare report? It says \"Medicare payments to hospitals were correct\".

The passage mentions \"Causes of Pain on the Right Side of the Waist Pain along the waist line may be caused by abnormal function of any of the organs in the pelvic region of the body.\" That is somewhat relevant: it mentions right side waist pain, pelvic region. The query is specifically \"right pelvic pain causes\". The passage does mention causes of right side waist pain, but not specifically pelvic pain. It says \"abnormal function of any of the organs in the pelvic region\". That is relevant. But it's not a perfect answer. So M likely 2. Trustworthiness? The passage seems generic, no source.

The passage is somewhat relevant but not precise. So M=2. T=1. O=2? Or maybe O=1? Let's think: The passage is somewhat relevant but not specific. The trustworthiness is low. So overall maybe 1. But the examples: For left ventricular hypertrophy, passage had a clear source (Mayo Clinic) and content relevant, so M=2, T=2, O=2. For anthropological definition, the passage was exactly relevant, so M=3, T=3, O=3. For the second anthropological example, irrelevant, so 0. So for our passage, it's somewhat relevant but not precise. So M=2. Trustworthiness: no source, so maybe T=1. O: combine M and T. If M=2, T=1, maybe O=1? But the instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O is final. If M=2, T=1, maybe O=1? But maybe O=2 if M is more important. But trustworthiness is also important. I'd lean O=1. But maybe O=2? Let's decide: The passage is somewhat relevant but not specific. Trustworthiness is low. So overall relevance is low. I'd give O=1.

They say \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows object. Probably produce object. We'll output {\"M\": X, \"T\": Y, \"O\": Z}. For the given passage and query \"right pelvic pain causes\".\n\nWe need to evaluate M: match to intent. The passage: \"Causes of Pain on the Right Side of the Waist. Pain along the waist line may be caused by abnormal function of any of the organs in the pelvic region of the body. Depending on the cause of the problem, waist pain might be mild or severe, aching or throbbing. Sitting and sleeping in improper position may lead to the pain located on the right side of the waist.\"\n\nQuery: \"right pelvic pain causes\". The passage mentions right side waist pain, caused by abnormal function of organs in pelvic region. That is somewhat relevant. It doesn't give specific causes, but mentions abnormal function of organs. It's somewhat relevant but not specific. So M maybe 2? It's somewhat relevant. T: trustworthiness? No source given, generic. Might be low trust. But we don't have info. Probably T=1? But trustworthiness is about the web page. We don't know. Might be low. But we can assign 1. O: overall maybe 1? But M=2, T=1, O maybe 1? The examples: For left ventricular hypertrophy passage, they gave M=2, T=2, O=2. That passage had specific cause. Here it's vague. So maybe M=1, T=1, O=1. But the passage does mention pelvic region. The query is \"right pelvic pain causes\". The passage says \"pain along the waist line may be caused by abnormal function of any of the organs in the pelvic region\". That is somewhat relevant. I'd give M=2? But trustworthiness maybe 1. O maybe 1? Let's decide: M=2, T=1, O=1. But maybe O should be average? The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O is final. If M high but T low, O might be moderate. I'd set O=1. So final JSON: {\"M\":2,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}."

They want definition of RSA key. The passage gives some definition: \"RSA key is a private key based on RSA algorithm. Private Key is used for authentication and a symmetric key exchange during establishment of an SSL/TLS session. It is a part of the public key infrastructure that is generally used in case of SSL certificates.\" That is somewhat relevant but not a full definition. It mentions private key, usage. The query likely expects definition of RSA key. The passage partially answers. So M maybe 2? But maybe 1? Let's think: The passage does not explicitly define RSA key as \"public key\" or \"private key\" but says \"RSA key is a private key based on RSA algorithm.\" That is a definition. It also explains usage. So it's somewhat relevant. I'd give M=2.\n\nT: trustworthiness. The passage seems generic, no source. Might be from some website. Hard to gauge. Probably moderate trust. I'd give T=2.\n\nO: overall. Considering M=2, T=2, O likely 2. So output: {\"M\": 2, \"T\": 2, \"O\": 2}."

The passage does mention RSA encryption is based on use of a public and a private key. It also mentions token generating a public key. It does not give a precise definition of RSA key, but it does mention key concept. The query \"rsa definition key\" maybe they want definition of RSA key. The passage partially answers: \"RSA encryption is based on use of a public and a private key.\" That is a definition. So it's somewhat relevant.

Passage: \"Social determinants of health are economic and social conditions that influence the health of people and communities [1]. These conditions are shaped by the amount of money, power, and resources that people have, all of which are influenced by policy choices.hese social determinants of health also interact with and influence individual behaviors as well. More specifically, social determinants of health refer to the set of factors that contribute to the social patterning of health, disease, and illness.\"\n\nThis passage directly defines social determinants of health. So M (match to intent) should be 3. T (trustworthiness) - we don't know source. It has a citation [1] but no source. Might be somewhat trustworthy but not certain. In examples, they gave 3 for a passage that is clearly authoritative. For this passage, maybe 2? But we can consider it's a generic definition, likely from a reputable source. But no explicit source. I'd give T=2. O final: combine M and T. Likely 2 or 3. Since M=3, T=2, O maybe 2.5? But must be integer 0-3. We can choose 2. So output {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}."

The passage: \"A cart displaying food produced in Switzerland. There are many regional dishes in Switzerland.

Foods often associated with Switzerland include cheese and chocolate.\"\n\nWe need to consider M: match to query. The query asks for most popular food in Switzerland. The passage mentions many foods, but does not specify which is most popular. It mentions Italian cuisine popular, cheese and chocolate associated. It doesn't give a definitive answer. So M likely 1 (related but not answer). T: trustworthiness of web page. We don't know source. The passage seems generic, maybe from a travel guide. Could be moderately trustworthy. But we don't have evidence. I'd give T 2? But guidelines: T is trustworthiness of web page. We don't know. Could be 2? But maybe 1? The passage is not obviously from a reputable source. But it's not obviously false. I'd give T 2? But we can consider T 2: somewhat trustworthy. O: overall. Since M low, T moderate, overall low. Maybe O 1. So final: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}. But we need to decide. Let's think: The passage does not answer the query. So M=1. T: trustworthiness unknown, but content seems plausible. I'd give T=2. O: combine: low relevance, moderate trust, overall low. So O=1. So output JSON object."

It says Pastetli is a popular food, but not necessarily the most popular. It also lists other foods. So answer is partially relevant but not definitive. So M maybe 2? Because it has some answer but unclear. T: trustworthiness? The passage seems like a random snippet, maybe from a website. Not obviously trustworthy. But we can assign 2? Or 1? The passage is not obviously authoritative. But it's not obviously false. I'd give T=2? But maybe 1 because not trustworthy. The passage is not from a known source. I'd lean T=2? But the guidelines: T is trustworthiness of web page. We don't know. I'd give 2? But maybe 1. Let's think: The passage is a snippet that might be from a travel guide. It's not obviously from a reputable source. So T=1. O: overall. M=2, T=1 => O maybe 1? But we need to decide. The overall score should reflect both. If M high but T low, overall moderate? I'd give O=1.5? But must be integer 0-3. So maybe O=1. So final: {\"M\":2,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}."
