But it does mention environment. The user might be looking for definition of environment in anthropology. The passage gives a definition of cultural ecology, which is about environment adaptation. So it's somewhat relevant but not perfect. So M maybe 1 or 2. Trustworthiness: K. Kris Hirst is presumably a scholar, but not sure. The passage seems credible. So T maybe 3. O maybe 1 or 2. Let's decide: M=1 (related but not answer). T=3 (trustworthy). O=1 (overall).

The passage mentions \"human ecology, the broad integrative area of anthropology that focuses on the interactions of culture, biology and the environment.\" It does not give a definition of environment, but mentions environment as part of human ecology. So it's somewhat related but not directly answering. So M maybe 1 or 2? The passage is about graduate program, not definition. So M likely 1 (related). T: trustworthiness? It's a university page, likely trustworthy. So T maybe 3. O: overall maybe 1 or 2. The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search.

The passage: \"Depression is a mental disorder that affects more than 350 million people across the globe. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it’s the leading cause of disability, a major contributor to global disease, and it leads to suicide – and some people may be prone to it more than others. After transgendered people, teenagers who have had family in the military have been found to experience more depression, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts than their peers without family in the military.\"\n\nThis passage mentions depression leading to suicide, and mentions that teenagers with family in the military have more depression, hopelessness, suicidal thoughts. It does not directly answer \"causes of military suicide\" but gives some context: depression, family in military. So it's somewhat related but not a direct answer. So M (match to intent) maybe 1 (related). T (trustworthiness) maybe 2? The passage cites WHO, but not a direct source. It's somewhat credible but not fully. So T maybe 2.

First, let's make sure you are using the right estimator for your project, here's a quick primer on concrete staining.\"\n\nThis passage is about stained concrete pricing for interior floors. The query is \"cost of interior concrete flooring\". The passage addresses cost of interior concrete flooring, specifically staining. So it's relevant. The answer may be a bit unclear because it doesn't give actual numbers, but says it will go over options and pricing. So it's highly relevant but not fully answering. So M=2. Trustworthiness? It's a website that presumably sells concrete staining. Might be trustworthy? It's a commercial site. But we don't have evidence. We can assign T=2.

The Act may authorize broad-based declaratory and injunctive relief without resort to class action procedures.\"\n\nWe need to consider M: match to query. The passage mentions Declaratory Judgment Act, but not definition. It gives some description. The query is \"definition declaratory judgment\". The passage does not give a definition but describes the act. So it's somewhat relevant but not perfect. So M maybe 2? The passage has some answer but not exact definition. So M=2.\n\nT: trustworthiness of web page. We don't know. But likely a legal text. Could be trustworthy. But we don't have info. We might assign 3? But we need to consider trustworthiness. Without info, maybe 3? But we can be conservative: 3? The passage seems from a legal source. I'd give T=3.\n\nO: overall. M=2, T=3. Weighted? The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O maybe 2? Because M is 2, T is 3. The overall relevance is 2.

The passage: \"Review: Triple Cheeseburger from McDonald’s. When it comes to the various sizes of classic McDonald’s cheeseburgers, the prices might have you scratching your head. The price differences between a McDonald’s Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\"\n\nThis passage mentions McDouble and Double Cheeseburger, but not difference in ingredients, just price differences. The query is about difference between a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger. The passage partially addresses difference: it says \"beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger\" which hints at difference. So it's somewhat relevant but not fully answering. So M: 2 (highly relevant). T: trustworthiness? It's a review from presumably a website, but we don't know. It's likely trustworthy? It's a review, but not official. I'd give T: 2 or 3? The passage is from a review, but not official McDonald's. Might be moderately trustworthy. I'd give T: 2. O: combine: maybe 2. So output: {\"M\": 2, \"T\": 2, \"O\": 2}.\n\nBut the instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores\" maybe they want array like [2,2,2]? But example shows object.

So M (match to intent) maybe 2? It's somewhat relevant but not fully. T (trustworthiness) maybe 1? It's a blog or personal commentary, not authoritative. So O maybe 1 or 2? The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So we need to produce M, T, O. M: 2 (highly relevant). T: 1 (related but not authoritative). O: maybe 1? But maybe 2? Let's think: The passage does mention difference in price and cheese pieces, but not a clear answer. So it's somewhat relevant but not fully. So M=2. T=1. O maybe 1? Because overall relevance is low. But maybe 2? The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" If M=2, T=1, maybe O=1? Because trustworthiness low. I'd set O=1. So output: {\"M\": 2, \"T\": 1, \"O\": 1}."

It addresses difference between RN and BSN? It says \"In 2011, ADNs earned about $64,000 on average while BSNs made $76,000.\" It also says \"RNs with BSN degrees may earn about $57,280. On the other hand, RNs with an ASN or ADN degree may land entry-level positions that will provide them with $40,250 on average.\" So it does talk about RN vs BSN salary differences. So it's relevant. The passage is somewhat repetitive but contains answer. So M=3. Trustworthiness: The passage cites Indeed website, but also says BLS does not calculate pay difference. It's somewhat credible but not authoritative. But it's a typical answer. So T=2 maybe. O=3? The final score O is likely the overall. They want a single score? The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So we need to output M, T, O. So M=3, T=2, O=3? Or maybe O=2? Let's think: The passage is relevant and contains answer. So M=3. Trustworthiness: It's not from official source, but it's from Indeed. So maybe T=2. O: The overall relevance and trustworthiness combined. Since M=3, T=2, overall maybe 3? But if trustworthiness is lower, maybe overall 2? The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" The relative importance: M likely more important. So overall maybe 3. So output {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}."

So we output something like {\"M\": 1, \"T\": 2, \"O\": 1}.\n\nWe need to evaluate the passage relative to query \"do goldfish grow\". The passage says: \"Don't Put Goldfish in a Fish Bowl. You can put a maximum of only one 1 long goldfish in a one-gallon fish bowl, and it usually will not do well. If it does well, it will quickly grow too big for a fish bowl. Goldfish are not appropriate fish for fish bowls.\"\n\nThe query: \"do goldfish grow\". The passage mentions that goldfish will quickly grow too big for a fish bowl. So it indicates that goldfish do grow. So the passage contains an answer: yes, goldfish grow. So M (match) should be 3? The passage is dedicated to the query? It's not exactly answering \"do goldfish grow?\" but it says \"If it does well, it will quickly grow too big for a fish bowl.\" That implies they grow. So it's somewhat relevant. I'd say M=2 (highly relevant). T: trustworthiness? It's a generic statement, not obviously from a reputable source. But it's a short passage. I'd give T=2. O: final score maybe 2. So output {\"M\":2,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}.\n\nBut we need to consider the instruction: \"Label every single document, do not leave anything blank.\" There's only one passage. So we output one JSON object. The example says \"Results {}\" maybe they want an array? The instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array.\" So maybe they want an array of objects? But they say \"Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\" That is confusing. They might want a JSON array of objects, each object for a document. But we have only one document. So array with one object: [{\"M\":2,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}]. But the example shows a single object. The phrase \"JSON array of scores\" suggests array. But the example shows object. The phrase \"Results {}\" maybe placeholder for output. I'd output a JSON object. But the instruction says \"JSON array of scores\". I'd output an array with one object. But the example shows object. The safe approach: output a JSON object. But the instruction says \"Do not add any text before or after the JSON array.\" So we must output exactly the JSON. If we output an array, it's still JSON. So I'd output [{\"M\":2,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}]. That is a JSON array containing one object. That satisfies \"JSON array of scores\". The example might be miswritten. I'll output array.\n\nThus final answer: [{\"M\":2,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}]."

The passage does mention \"A suitable example for this is monotonic functions or linear polynomials.\" But it's vague. It doesn't give a concrete example like f(x)=x or f(x)=x^2. It says \"monotonic functions or linear polynomials.\" That is somewhat an example but not explicit. So M maybe 2? It's somewhat relevant but unclear. T: trustworthiness of web page. The passage seems poorly written, maybe not trustworthy. So T maybe 1? But we need to decide. The passage is not well-structured, but it's about monotonic functions. Could be from a low-quality source. So T maybe 1. O: overall. Weighted maybe 2? Let's decide: M=2, T=1, O=2? Or maybe O=1? Let's think: The passage does mention monotonic functions and gives an example: \"linear polynomials\". That is a type of monotonic function. But it's not a specific example. The query wants an example. The passage partially answers but not clearly. So M=2. Trustworthiness: The passage is poorly written, but it's about monotonic functions.

The passage: \"Note that just monotonic transformation of a concave function is not necessarily concave: consider, for example f (x) = x and g (z) = z 3 .Thus the concavity of a function is not ordinal, it is cardinal property.Economic ExampleSuppose production function f (x) is concave and the cost function c (x) is convex.ote that just monotonic transformation of a concave function is not necessarily concave: consider, for example f (x) = x and g (z) = z 3 .Thus the concavity of a function is not ordinal, it is cardinal property.Economic ExampleSuppose production function f (x) is concave and the cost function c (x) is convex.\"\n\nThe passage mentions monotonic transformation of a concave function, but not an example of a monotonic function itself. It gives f(x)=x and g(z)=z^3 as an example of monotonic transformation? Actually f(x)=x is monotonic, g(z)=z^3 is monotonic. But the passage is about monotonic transformation of concave function. The query: \"example of monotonic function\". The passage does mention f(x)=x and g(z)=z^3, which are monotonic functions. So it partially answers. But it's not dedicated to the query. So maybe score 2? Let's evaluate M: relevance to query. The passage contains an example of monotonic function: f(x)=x and g(z)=z^3. So it's somewhat relevant. But the passage is about concavity, not specifically monotonic functions. So M maybe 2. T: trustworthiness? The passage seems like a snippet from a math or economics text. It's not obviously trustworthy but it's not obviously false. I'd give T=2. O: overall maybe 2. So output {\"M\":2,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}."

It does not provide a definition of exons. It mentions \"EDA exon\" but not definition. So it's not answering the query. So M (match) is low: maybe 1 (related but not answer). T (trustworthiness) is a peer-reviewed journal article, so high trust: maybe 3. O (overall) would be maybe 1 or 2? Since M is 1, T is 3, overall maybe 1. Because overall is weighted by M more.

It's somewhat related but not answering. So M (match to intent) maybe 1 (related). T (trustworthiness) maybe 3? The passage seems factual but not authoritative. But we can assign 2?

The passage is minimal, but not obviously trustworthy. I'd give T=2? But maybe 1? The passage is not providing answer, but it's a link to more detailed page. So trustworthiness maybe 2?

Trustworthiness T: The passage seems generic, but not obviously from a reputable source. It's a short snippet, but likely from a general educational site. We can assign T=2 maybe.

The passage: \"LPS requirements are covered in clause 2.5 of the standard. Interestingly, LPS is not defined in clause 1.2 of the standard, the definitions section, or in clause 2.5, the LPS requirements section. I’ll take a crack at writing a succinct definition for LPS:\" So the passage acknowledges that LPS is not defined, and says \"I'll take a crack at writing a succinct definition for LPS:\" but doesn't actually provide the definition. So does it answer the query? The query is \"lps laws definition\". The passage says LPS is not defined in the standard, but will attempt to write a definition. It doesn't provide the definition. So it's not a perfect answer. It's somewhat relevant: it mentions LPS and that it's not defined, but doesn't give the definition. So it's somewhat related but not answering. So maybe score 1 for related. But we need to consider M, T, O. M: match to query. The passage partially addresses the query but doesn't give the definition. So M maybe 1. T: trustworthiness. The passage seems like a snippet from a standard or a discussion. It's not obviously trustworthy. But it's a snippet from a standard? It says \"LPS requirements are covered in clause 2.5 of the standard.\" That seems like a legitimate reference. So trustworthiness maybe 2? But it's not a full definition. So T maybe 2. O: overall. We combine M and T. M=1, T=2. O maybe 1? Or maybe 2? The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O is final. If M=1, T=2, maybe O=1.

RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers. Based on this principle, the RSA encryption algorithm uses prime factorization as the trap door for encryption. Deducing an RSA key, therefore, takes a huge amount of time and processing power.

The passage seems generic, but not relevant. T maybe 2? But trustworthiness is about the page's trust. The passage is generic, but not relevant. But we can assign T=2? But maybe T=1? The passage is not about dysarthria, but it's about cerebral palsy. The trustworthiness of the page? Hard to gauge. But we can assign T=2? But the instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" The passage is generic, but not obviously from a reputable source. But we can assign T=2? But maybe 1. Let's think: The passage is a snippet from a website about cerebral palsy. It might be from a medical site. But we don't know. So maybe T=2. But the main relevance is 0. So O likely 0. Because overall relevance is 0. So final: {\"M\":0,\"T\":2,\"O\":0}. But maybe T=1? But trustworthiness is separate. The passage is generic, but not obviously from a reputable source. I'd lean T=2? But the instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" We don't have info. I'd assign T=2? But maybe 1. Let's choose 2. So final JSON: {\"M\":0,\"T\":2,\"O\":0}."
