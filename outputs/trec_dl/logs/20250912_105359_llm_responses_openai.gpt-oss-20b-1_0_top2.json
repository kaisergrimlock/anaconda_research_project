The passage is about \"Stained Concrete chi phí sàn bê tông nội thất Pricing - Interior Ver. 4.3.

So it is relevant. The passage contains partial answer: it says \"pricing for them\" but not actual numbers. It says \"we will go over some of the options that are available for concrete staining for interior floors and the pricing for them.\" So it indicates that it will provide pricing but not actual numbers. So it's partially relevant. The query: cost of interior concrete flooring. The passage is about cost of interior concrete flooring (staining). So M: 3? The passage is dedicated to the query and contains partial answer. But does it contain actual numbers? It says \"pricing for them\" but not actual numbers. So it's partial answer.

The passage is in Vietnamese partially: \"Are assigned as Nguyên nhân tự tử quân sự additional codes to indicate how the injury or health condition happened (cause), the intent (unintentional or accidental; intentional , such as suicide or assault), the palce where the even occurred, the activity of the patient at the time of the event, and the person's status (e.g., civilian, military\". The query: \"causes of military suicide\". The passage seems to mention \"Nguyên nhân tự tử quân sự\" which is Vietnamese for \"causes of military suicide\". It also mentions additional codes to indicate cause, intent, etc. So it is somewhat relevant. It contains partial answer: it says \"Nguyên nhân tự tử quân sự\" and mentions codes for cause. But it's not a full answer. So M: relevance: 2? It seems related but not fully. T: trustworthiness: unclear, maybe 1? It's a snippet, not full context. O: overall: maybe 2. So output: {\"M\":2,\"T\":1,\"O\":2}."
