The passage: \"One factor which supports the dismissal of a declaratory judgment action is the conduct of the insurer in filing such a declaratory judgment action to pre-empt the insured from having a choice of forum in a first party claim.\"\n\nWe need to consider M: match to query. The query is \"definition declaratory judgment\". The passage does not provide a definition; it discusses dismissal of a declaratory judgment action. So it's not directly answering the definition. So M likely low. Maybe 1? Because it mentions declaratory judgment action, but not definition. So M=1.\n\nT: trustworthiness of web page. We don't have info. Assume generic? Probably moderate? But we can't know. We might assign 2? But we need to consider trustworthiness. The passage seems like a legal analysis, maybe from a law review. But we don't know. I'd assign 2? But maybe 1? The instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" We have no info. We might assume average trustworthiness: 2. But we could also assign 1 if uncertain. Let's think: The passage is a snippet from a legal discussion. It's likely from a reputable source. But we can't be sure. I'd lean 2.\n\nNow O: overall. The passage does not provide a definition.

The passage addresses difference in pay and professional opportunity. So it's relevant. I'd give M=3. T: trustworthiness: PayScale is a pay data aggregator, not official. So maybe 2.

The passage says: \"If the tank is not large enough to allow the goldfish to grow, it's growth will be stunted and this can cause the fish to become unhealthy and die. The fancy goldfish do not get as large as the common/comet/shubunkin/feeder goldfish. The more room you can give your goldfish, the faster it will grow.\"\n\nSo the passage addresses growth of goldfish, mentions that they grow, but growth depends on tank size. So it contains partial answer: yes, goldfish grow, but growth can be stunted. So M: matches intent: yes. Score 3? The passage is dedicated to query? It addresses growth. So M=3. T: trustworthiness? We don't know source. But passage seems factual. Might be moderate. Score 2? But we can assign 2. O: final score: maybe 3? Because passage contains answer. But trustworthiness moderate. The final score maybe 3? The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O likely weighted by M and T. M=3, T=2.

The passage is somewhat incorrect: exons are expressed as proteins? Actually exons are coding sequences that are transcribed and spliced into mRNA, then translated. The passage says \"expressed as proteins\" which is not accurate. Also introns are not expressed. The passage is somewhat wrong. So trustworthiness is low. The content partially addresses exons definition but is inaccurate. So M maybe 2? It contains partial answer but unclear. T maybe 1? Because it's not trustworthy. O maybe 1? Let's think: M: 2 (partial answer). T: 1 (some trust issues). O: maybe 1 or 2? The overall score should reflect both. If M=2 and T=1, overall maybe 1? The guidelines: 0 nothing, 1 related but no answer, 2 partial answer but unclear, 3 dedicated answer. The passage is partially answering but unclear. So O=2. But trustworthiness is low, but overall still partial answer. The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So we weigh M and T. M=2, T=1. Weighted maybe 0.7*2 + 0.3*1 = 1.7 => round to 2?

It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time.

Humans can be bitten, though a long-term population of cat fleas cannot be sustained and infest people.However, if the female flea is allowed to feed for 12 consecutive hours on a human, it can lay viable eggs.he cat flea's primary host is the domestic cat, but it is also the primary flea infesting dogs in most of the world. The cat flea can also maintain its life cycle on other carnivores and on omnivores. Humans can be bitten, though a long-term population of cat fleas cannot be sustained and infest people.\nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search.

They might be confused about location. They want to know if CDG is in Paris city or outside. The passage: \"The nearest major airport is Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport (CDG / LFPG). This airport has international and domestic flights from Paris, France and is 40 km from the center of Disneyland Paris.\"\n\nSo passage says CDG is a major airport in Paris, France, 40 km from Disneyland. It indicates it's in Paris. So it answers the query partially: yes, it's in Paris. So M (match) high. T (trustworthiness) maybe moderate: it's factual, but we don't know source. But likely trustworthy. So T maybe 2 or 3. O final maybe 3 because passage dedicated to query and contains answer.\n\nThus M=3, T=3, O=3. But maybe T=2 because we don't know source. But we can assume it's trustworthy. I'd give 3.\n\nReturn JSON: {\"M\":3,\"T\":3,\"O\":3}"

The passage is not a full answer but gives a possible cause. So M (match) maybe 2? Because it addresses the cause. T (trustworthiness) unknown; we don't have info. Assume moderate trust? Maybe 1? But we need to decide. The passage is not a comprehensive answer but mentions a cause. So M=2. T maybe 1? But we can assume it's a typical medical article? The passage is short. Might be from a medical website. But we don't know. I'd give T=1. Then O maybe 2? Because partial answer. So final JSON: {\"M\":2,\"T\":1,\"O\":2}."

    "prompt": "Given a query and a passage, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 3 with the following meaning: 0 = represent that the passage has nothing to do with the query, 1 = represents that the passage seems related to the query but does not contain any part of an answer to it, 2 = represents that the passage contains a partial or complete answer for the query, but the answer may be a bit unclear, or hidden amongst extraneous information and 3 = represents that the passage is dedicated to the query and contains a partial or complete answer to it.  \nAssume that you are writing a report on the subject of the topic. \nA person has typed \"what is theraderm used for\" into a search engine.\nConsider the following passage: Incoming search phrases: what do celebrities use to bleach their skin, what do celebrities use to whiten their skin, what do celebrities use to lighten their skin, what are celebrities using to bleach their skin, what are celebrities using to whiten their skin, what are celebrities using to lighten their skin, do celebrities use whitening creams, do celebrities use bleaching creams, do celebrities use lightening creams\nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O). Final score must be an integer value only. Do not provide any code in result. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}",

The passage is about \"incoming search phrases: what do celebrities use to bleach their skin, ...\". This passage is unrelated to the query. So M=0. Trustworthiness? The passage is just a list of search phrases, not a trustworthy source. So T=0. Final O=0. Provide JSON array? The instruction: \"Do not provide any code in result. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\" So we output JSON object. Probably just {\"M\":0,\"T\":0,\"O\":0}."
