It is expressed as. where A is the area of the trapezoid, h is the height, and b1 and b2 are the lengths of the two bases.

Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\"\n\nIt says \"Label every single document, do not leave anything blank.\" There's only one passage. So we produce JSON array? Wait: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores\" but example shows object. Might be confusion. The example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}. That seems like they want an object with keys M, T, O. But they say array. Maybe they want array of objects? But only one document. So array with one object? The example shows just object. The instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\"\n\nMaybe they want to output: {\"M\": 3, \"T\": 3, \"O\": 3} or something. But they say array. Could be a mistake. Let's interpret: They want a JSON object with keys M, T, O. Provide scores. So we need to compute M, T, O.\n\nWe need to consider the query: \"do goldfish grow\". The passage: \"Get a large enough tank. The minimum tank size for one goldfish is 10-15 US gallons (56.7 liters)(Remember, they grow to about 10-12 inches (25.5-30.5 centimeters), and sometimes over!) and you will need to add 10 U.S. gallons (37.8 liters) onto that for each additional goldfish.\"\n\nThe passage indeed addresses goldfish growth: \"they grow to about 10-12 inches\". So it's relevant. The passage is dedicated to the query? It contains the answer: yes, goldfish grow to about 10-12 inches. So M=3. Trustworthiness? The passage seems like a typical aquarium advice. Not sure about trustworthiness. But likely moderate. We can assign T=2 or 3. Let's assign T=2 (some trust but not verified). O = combine M and T. Since M=3, T=2, O maybe 3? The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O is final relevance. If M=3 and T=2, O maybe 3? But maybe O=2.5? But must be integer 0-3. I'd say O=3 because content matches query well. So output: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}. Provide as JSON array? They said array but example shows object. I'll output object."

Passage: \"Play with a trapezoid: The parallel sides are the bases The other two sides are the legs The distance (at right angles) from one base to the other is called the altitude Area of a Trapezoid\". This passage does not mention midsegment. So M likely 0. T: trustworthiness of web page. We don't know. But passage seems generic. I'd give 1 maybe. O: overall relevance. Since M=0, overall likely 0. But maybe T=1, but overall 0. So output: {\"M\":0,\"T\":1,\"O\":0}. But they want array? I'll output array: [{\"M\":0,\"T\":1,\"O\":0}]."

First, let's establish some definitions: f is said to be increasing on an interval I if for all x in I, whenever. f is said to be decreasing on an interval I if for all x in I, whenever. A function is monotonic on an interval I if it is only increasing or only decreasing on I. The derivative can help us determine whether a function is increasing or decreasing on an interval. This knowledge will later allow us to sketch rough graphs of functions. Let f be continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b) . If for all x on (a, b) , then f is increasing on [a, b] . If for all x on (a, b) , then f is decreasing on [a, b] . This should make intuitive sense.

The wind. All objects on the earth's surface are exposed to the wind, along with many other elements â water, the sun, temperature changes. Over time, these factors wear objects down and break them apart. The resulting bits and pieces of material are called sediment. Sediment is then transported by wind and water, often ending up far from where it started. These processes of breakdown and transport due to exposure to the environment are called weathering and erosion. Weathering and erosion affect all rocks on the earth's surface. Compacting & Cementing What happens to a loose pile of garbage when it's put into a compactor? The squeezing of the machine produces a solid cube of compacted garbage. The same thing happens to sediment formed from the weathering and erosion of rock. Over time, sediment accumulates in oceans, lakes, and valleys, eventually building up in layers and weighing down the material underneath.\nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search.

So M=0. Trustworthiness? The passage seems credible but not relevant. T maybe 2? But trustworthiness is about the web page. The passage is a snippet from a website about Baker Act. It's likely trustworthy. But since it's not relevant, we might still give T=2. O final maybe 0. So output {\"M\":0,\"T\":2,\"O\":0}."
