First, let's make sure you are using the right estimator for your project, here's a quick primer on concrete staining.\"\n\nSo the passage is about cost of interior concrete flooring, specifically staining. It contains the phrase \"cost\" and \"pricing\". So it's relevant. The query: \"cost of interior concrete flooring\". The passage addresses cost of interior concrete flooring. So M (match) should be 3. Trustworthiness: unknown. It's a website page about concrete staining cost. Might be moderately trustworthy. But we don't have evidence. We can assign T=2 maybe. O final: maybe 3? But trustworthiness might reduce. But the instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So we need to produce M, T, O. M=3, T=2, O maybe 3? Or maybe 2? Let's think: The passage is relevant and contains cost info. Trustworthiness uncertain. But we can give T=2. O maybe 3 because content matches query. But if trustworthiness is lower, maybe O=2. The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" Usually relevance is more important. So O=3. Let's output JSON object: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}."

Description, Causes and Risk Factors: Abbreviation: RVH. Right ventricular hypertrophy is the increase or the enlargement in the size of the right ventricle of the heart. The right ventricle is responsible for pumping blood towards the lungs. In the lungs, blood is mixed with oxygen and 左心室肥大的病因 then pumped back to the left ventricle to be eventually distributed to the brain and to other parts of the body.
