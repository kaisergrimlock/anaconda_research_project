M: relevance to query. The passage mentions McDouble and Double Cheeseburger, but it's about price differences, not the difference in composition. The query asks difference between a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger. The passage does mention both, but only in context of price differences. It does not answer the difference in ingredients. So it's partially relevant but not fully. According to guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. This is somewhat related but not answering. So M=1.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage is a review, presumably from a website. It's not a primary source but likely trustworthy. But we don't have evidence of reliability. It's a review, but it's about price differences. It's likely trustworthy. I'd give T=2? But guidelines: 3 perfect trustworthiness, 2 highly trustworthy, 1 related, 0 irrelevant.

The difference between an RN and a BSN is that an RN is a title for a registered nurse, while a BSN stands for a Bachelor of Science in nursing. Learn about the differences between degrees and licenses with help from a licensed RN in this free video on nursing jobs and health care.\"\n\nQuery: \"difference between rn and bsn\"\n\nWe need to score:\n\nIntent match M: The passage directly addresses the difference between RN and BSN. It says \"The difference between an RN and a BSN is that an RN is a title for a registered nurse, while a BSN stands for a Bachelor of Science in nursing.\" That is a direct answer. So M=3.\n\nTrustworthiness T: The passage seems to be from some source, but we don't know. It says \"Learn about the differences between degrees and licenses with help from a licensed RN in this free video on nursing jobs and health care.\" It's not obviously authoritative. But it's not obviously false. It's a general statement. We can assign T=2 maybe. But guidelines: 3 perfect trustworthiness, 2 highly trustworthy, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. The passage is likely trustworthy but not necessarily authoritative. I'd give T=2.\n\nOverall O: Should be some combination. Usually O is maybe average or something. But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" but no explicit formula. We can consider O as maybe the average of M and T? But we can just assign a score that reflects overall. Since M=3, T=2, overall maybe 3? But we need to decide. The passage is relevant and somewhat trustworthy. I'd give O=3? But maybe O=2? Let's think: The passage is relevant and somewhat trustworthy. The overall score might be 3 if we consider it highly relevant and trustworthy. But trustworthiness is 2, so overall maybe 2? The guidelines don't specify how to compute O. But we can interpret O as overall quality. I'd give O=3 because it's a perfect answer. But trustworthiness is 2, so maybe O=2? Let's read guidelines: \"For each given query and its associated passages, assign scores on an integer scale from 0 to 3 for measures of intent match (M), trustworthiness (T), and overall score (O).\" So O is separate. We can decide O based on both M and T. I'd give O=3 because it's a perfect answer. But trustworthiness is 2, so maybe O=2? The passage is not extremely trustworthy but it's correct. I'd lean O=3 because it's a perfect answer. But maybe O=2 because trustworthiness is not perfect. The guidelines don't specify. I'd choose O=3 because it's a perfect answer. But we can also choose O=2. Let's think: The passage is a direct answer, but the trustworthiness is not perfect. The overall score might reflect both. I'd give O=3? But maybe O=2. Let's decide: I'd give O=3 because it's a perfect answer. But trustworthiness is 2, so overall maybe 2.5? But we need integer. I'd choose O=3? Let's read the example: They didn't give example of O. But we can interpret O as overall quality. I'd give O=3 because it's a perfect answer. But trustworthiness is 2, so maybe O=2. I'd choose O=3? Let's decide: The passage is a direct answer, but the trustworthiness is not perfect. I'd give O=3? But maybe O=2. Let's choose O=3? Actually, the passage is a direct answer, but the trustworthiness is not perfect. The overall score might be 3 because it's a perfect answer. But trustworthiness is 2, so overall might be 2.5? But we need integer. I'd choose O=3? Let's choose O=3. But I'm not fully sure. Let's think: The passage is a direct answer, but the trustworthiness is not perfect. The overall score might be 3 because it's a perfect answer. But trustworthiness is 2, so overall might be 2. I'd choose O=3? Let's decide: I'd give O=3.

It does not directly define \"environment\" anthropologically. It defines cultural ecology. So it's somewhat related but not directly answering. So M likely 1 (related). T: trustworthiness.

The passage partially addresses that LVH can be part of various syndromes caused by underlying diseases, but does not list them. So it's somewhat relevant but not fully answering.

The passage mentions that suicide surpassed war as leading cause of death, but does not list causes of military suicide. It addresses the fact that suicide is leading cause, but not causes. So it's somewhat related but not answering. So M: 1 (related). T: trustworthiness? It's referencing a bar chart published this week in a. Post to Facebook. That seems not very trustworthy. It's unclear source. So T: maybe 1 (some trustworthiness but uncertain). O: overall: maybe 1. So output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}."
