The underlying purpose of the query \"causes of left ventricular hypertrophy\" is to find information about the causes of left ventricular hypertrophy, a condition where the left ventricle of the heart becomes thickened.\n2. The passage provided is about right ventricular hypertrophy, which is a different condition affecting the right ventricle. It does not contain any information about the causes of left ventricular hypertrophy, so the alignment with the query is low, scoring a 1.\n3. The passage seems to provide some factual information about right ventricular hypertrophy, such as the role of ventricular septal defect, so the trustworthiness is moderate, scoring a 2.\n4. Since the passage is not relevant to the query and only provides tangential information, the overall relevance score is 1."

I have seen goldfish grow ridiculously large in very small containers when their water was changed frequently. Goldfish will not grow if water conditions are poor. Fancy goldfish donât grow as large as Common goldfish. A good size would be around 5 inches body length for most fancy varieties, 8 inches for Comets and 12 inches for Common Goldfish. These sizes are usually only attained by pond grown fish.\nProcess this task in the following steps:\n1. Determine the underlying purpose of the query.\n2. Assess how well the passage aligns with the likely intent of the query (M).\n3. Evaluate the trustworthiness of the passage (T).\n4. Weigh both alignment and trustworthiness, then decide on an overall relevance score (O).\nAfter assigning each score, validate your choice for that category in 1-2 lines and proceed, correcting if inconsistent. Final score must be an integer value only. Do not provide any code in result. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. If either the query or passage is missing or empty, assign a score of 0 for M, T, and O. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}",

Some species live mainly in cold waters, while some others prefer warmer waters. SHARK MIGRATION. One thing is for sure; sharks migrate to find new sources of food and they can travel up to hundreds of miles to do that. Most species of sharks live in the oceans. However, some of them are known to dwell in bodies of freshwater, like the bull shark which travels up to 4,000 Km up the Amazon River. Sometimes, sharks reach freshwater bodies; this could be the result of the destruction of their habitat by human activities.\nProcess this task in the following steps:\n1. Determine the underlying purpose of the query.\n2. Assess how well the passage aligns with the likely intent of the query (M).\n3. Evaluate the trustworthiness of the passage (T).\n4.

This aligns well with the intent of the query, so the alignment score is 2.\n3. The passage appears to be a trustworthy source of information, as it provides a technical and detailed explanation of the topic. The passage does not seem to have any obvious biases or inaccuracies, so the trustworthiness score is 3.\n4. Considering both the alignment and trustworthiness, the overall relevance score is 3, as the passage directly addresses the query and provides a comprehensive answer."

RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers. Based on this principle, the RSA encryption algorithm uses prime factorization as the trap door for encryption. Deducing an RSA key, therefore, takes a huge amount of time and processing power. RSA is the standard encryption method for important data, especially data that's transmitted over the Internet.\nProcess this task in the following steps:\n1. Determine the underlying purpose of the query.\n2. Assess how well the passage aligns with the likely intent of the query (M).\n3. Evaluate the trustworthiness of the passage (T).\n4.
