The passage contains cost of interior concrete flooring: $92 per yard for 3000 psi. So it's relevant. It's not exactly the answer? The query: \"cost of interior concrete flooring\". The passage gives cost per yard for interior floors. So it's a direct answer. So M=3.\n\nT: Trustworthiness. It's a company statement. It's presumably a source. But we don't know if it's trustworthy. It's a direct statement. It's likely trustworthy. But we might give 2? The guidelines: 3: Perfectly relevant. 2: Highly relevant. 1: Related. 0: Irrelevant. For trustworthiness, we need to evaluate trustworthiness. The passage is from a company, presumably credible. But we don't have evidence. I'd give 2. But maybe 3? The passage is a direct statement of cost. It's likely trustworthy. But we can't guarantee. I'd give 2.\n\nO: Overall score. Usually average of M and T? Not specified. But we can combine.

But if trustworthiness is 2, overall might be 2? The guidelines don't specify how to compute O. We need to decide. I'd think overall is a combined measure. If M=3 and T=2, overall maybe 3? But maybe 2? I'd lean 3 because it's highly relevant and fairly trustworthy. But maybe 2.5? But must be integer. I'd choose 3? But risk. Let's think: The passage is a direct cost. It's relevant. Trustworthiness: It's a company statement. Might be considered trustworthy. I'd give 3 for trustworthiness. But we can't be sure. But the guidelines: \"Trustworthiness\" measure.

The price differences between a McDonald’s Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\"\n\nWe need to score M, T, O. M: relevance to query. The passage mentions McDouble and Double Cheeseburger, but it's about price differences, not the difference in composition. The query asks difference between a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger. The passage does mention both, but only in context of price differences. It does not answer the difference in ingredients. So it's partially relevant but not fully. According to guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. This is somewhat related but not answering. So M=1.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage is a review, presumably from a website. It's a review of Triple Cheeseburger, but mentions price differences. It's not a primary source. But it's likely trustworthy? It's a review, but not necessarily authoritative. But it's a review, not a fact-check. The passage is not obviously unreliable. I'd give T=2? But guidelines: trustworthiness: 3 perfect trust, 2 highly trustworthy, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. The passage is a review, but not necessarily authoritative. I'd say it's somewhat trustworthy but not authoritative. So T=2? Or maybe 1? The passage is not a direct source of difference. But trustworthiness refers to the passage's reliability. It's a review, but not necessarily inaccurate. I'd give T=2.\n\nOverall score O: combine? Probably average? But guidelines: overall score is a combined measure. I'd give O=1? Because relevance low. But trustworthiness high. But overall maybe 1.5? But must be integer 0-3. I'd choose O=1. Because relevance low. So final JSON: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}."
