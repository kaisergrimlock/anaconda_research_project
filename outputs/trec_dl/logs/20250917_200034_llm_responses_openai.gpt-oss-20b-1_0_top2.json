RN and BSN Demands and Salary. With all else equal, RNs with BSN degrees receive higher salaries than those with ASN or ADN degrees.n 2011, ADNs earned about $64,000 on average while BSNs made $76,000. These rates are based on the Indeed website as the BLS does not calculate the pay difference between RNs with ASN and BSN degrees. RN versus BSN Salary Based on Experience.

The query is asking how some sharks are warm blooded. The passage states that Great white sharks are some of the only warm blooded sharks.

So M likely 2 or 3? The passage is dedicated to the query? It says \"Great white sharks are some of the only warm blooded sharks.\" That is a direct answer. So M maybe 3. But the query is \"how are some sharks warm blooded\" which might be interpreted as \"how are some sharks warm blooded\" meaning \"what makes them warm blooded\" or \"which sharks are warm blooded\". The passage says \"Great white sharks are some of the only warm blooded sharks.\" That addresses the second interpretation. So M maybe 3.\n\nT: trustworthiness. The passage seems like a snippet from a website, maybe a summary. It says \"5 people found this useful.\" That suggests it's from a Q&A site. It's likely trustworthy but not high. I'd give T 2.\n\nO: final score. We weigh M and T. M high, T moderate. So O maybe 2 or 3. The passage is dedicated to the query? It directly answers. So O 3. But T is 2, so maybe O 2. The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So we weigh M and T. M=3, T=2. I'd lean O=2.5 but must be integer. I'd choose 2.

Some species live mainly in cold waters, while some others prefer warmer waters. SHARK MIGRATION. One thing is for sure; sharks migrate to find new sources of food and they can travel up to hundreds of miles to do that. Most species of sharks live in the oceans. However, some of them are known to dwell in bodies of freshwater, like the bull shark which travels up to 4,000 Km up the Amazon River.

The passage: \"Chronic pelvic pain is pain in the area below your bellybutton and between your hips that lasts six months or longer. Chronic pelvic pain can have multiple causes. It can be a symptom of another disease, or it can be a condition in its own right. If your chronic pelvic pain appears to be caused by another medical problem, treating that problem may be enough to eliminate your pain.\"\n\nThe query: \"right pelvic pain causes\". The passage mentions chronic pelvic pain, multiple causes, but not specifically right pelvic pain. It is somewhat related: it mentions causes of pelvic pain. But not specific to right side. So it's somewhat related but not specific. According to scoring: 0 = nothing to do, 1 = related but no answer, 2 = partial or complete answer but unclear, 3 = dedicated to query and contains answer. This passage is somewhat related but not specific. So M maybe 1? T maybe 2? Let's think.\n\nWe need to produce M, T, O. M: measure how well content matches likely intent. The query is \"right pelvic pain causes\". The passage is about chronic pelvic pain causes in general. So it's somewhat related but not specific. So M maybe 1. T: trustworthiness of passage. It's a general medical description, likely trustworthy. So T maybe 2 or 3. But we need to decide. The passage is from a presumably credible source? It's generic. I'd say T=2. O: final score. Since it's not dedicated to query, but contains partial answer. So O maybe 1 or 2. According to guidelines: 1 = related but no answer. 2 = partial or complete answer but unclear. The passage does mention causes but not specific. So it's partial answer. So O=2. So final: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}."

RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers. Based on this principle, the RSA encryption algorithm uses prime factorization as the trap door for encryption. Deducing an RSA key, therefore, takes a huge amount of time and processing power. RSA is the standard encryption method for important data, especially data that's transmitted over the Internet.  \nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search.

Dysarthria is a relatively common symptom of multiple sclerosis and can take many forms.Episodic paroxysmal dysarthria, which is where the dysarthria lasts for up to a minute or so and recurs several times a day, is particulary common in MS.ysarthria refers to speech problems that are caused by the muscles involved with speaking or the nerves controlling them.
