Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor â such as high blood pressure or a heart condition â that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.  \nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search.

I have seen goldfish grow ridiculously large in very small containers when their water was changed frequently. Goldfish will not grow if water conditions are poor.

RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers. Based on this principle, the RSA encryption algorithm uses prime factorization as the trap door for encryption. Deducing an RSA key, therefore, takes a huge amount of time and processing power.

However, the query does not explicitly mention dysarthria, so it's possible the user is also interested in learning about cerebral palsy in general, and how it affects muscle tone.\n\nStep 2: Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M)\nThe passage focuses on spastic cerebral palsy, which is a type of cerebral palsy. It explains how spastic cerebral palsy affects muscle tone, but it does not mention dysarthria or any other types of cerebral palsy. Therefore, the passage is somewhat related to the query (M=1).\n\nStep 3: Measure how trustworthy the passage is (T)\nThe passage is from a reputable source (Cerebral Palsy Alliance Australia), and it provides accurate and detailed information about spastic cerebral palsy. However, it does not provide any information about dysarthria or other types of cerebral palsy, so its relevance to the query is limited (T=1).\n\nStep 4: Decide on a final score (O)\nThe passage is from a trustworthy source and provides accurate information about spastic cerebral palsy, but it does not address the user's query about types of dysarthria caused by cerebral palsy.

Therefore, the O score would also be 0, indicating that the passage has nothing to do with the query.\n\nFinal score: {\"M\": 0, \"T\": 1, \"O\": 0}"
