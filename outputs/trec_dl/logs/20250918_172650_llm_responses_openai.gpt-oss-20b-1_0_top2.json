So it's highly relevant. M: 3? The passage contains the exact answer. It defines the terminal part of an axon and synonyms. So M=3. T: trustworthiness? It's a snippet from a website? The passage seems like a definition. Might be from a dictionary or educational site. We don't know trustworthiness. But likely moderate. But we can assign T=2? The passage is likely from a credible source? The date 2013. It's a definition. I'd give T=2. O: overall: 3? Since M=3, T=2, overall maybe 3?

The passage is not obviously trustworthy. But it's a list of topics. I'd give T=2? But maybe 1? The passage is not providing answer, but it's a list of topics that might lead to causes. It's not a direct answer. So trustworthiness maybe 2? But the passage is not a direct source. I'd lean 2? But the instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" The passage is generic, no source. I'd give 2? But maybe 1? Let's think: The passage is likely from a medical site, but we don't know. It's a list of topics. I'd give T=2? But maybe 1? The passage is not providing answer, but it's a list of topics that might be relevant. It's not obviously trustworthy. I'd give T=1. But the example: For a passage that is not relevant, they gave 0 for all. For a passage that is relevant but not clear, they gave 2 for M, 2 for T, 2 for O. So trustworthiness is separate. The passage is not a direct answer, but it's a list of topics. I'd give M=1, T=2? But trustworthiness maybe 2 because it's a medical site? But we don't know. I'd give T=2? But maybe 1. Let's decide: The passage is not a direct answer, but it's a list of topics that might lead to causes. It's somewhat trustworthy as a medical site. I'd give T=2. So O (overall) maybe 1? Because M=1, T=2, overall maybe 1. The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O likely between 0-3. I'd give O=1.

The passage is likely trustworthy? It's a generic description, maybe from a website. We don't have evidence of trustworthiness. But we can assume moderate trust. So M=2, T=2, O=2. But maybe M=3? The passage directly addresses cost. It says \"Find out average prices and what design features contribute to the cost of concrete flooring.\" That is exactly the answer. So M=3. T maybe 2. O maybe 3? But trustworthiness uncertain. But we can give 3 for M, 2 for T, 3 for O? But O is final score combining M and T. They said \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O likely between 0-3. If M=3 and T=2, O maybe 3? Or maybe 2? The passage is relevant but trust uncertain. I'd lean O=3 because it's relevant and likely trustworthy enough. But maybe 2. Let's think: The passage is a generic marketing page. Might not be authoritative. But the question is about cost. The passage says \"Find out average prices\". That is a direct answer. So M=3. T maybe 2. O maybe 3? The relative importance: M likely more important. So O=3. So output: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}."

It mentions price differences. The query is about difference between a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger. The passage does mention both, but not the difference. It says price differences are within 50 cents. So it partially answers: difference is price difference. But not fully. So it's somewhat relevant. So M: 2 (highly relevant). T: trustworthiness? It's a review, presumably from a website. Might be trustworthy? It's a review, but not necessarily authoritative. But it's about McDonald's burgers. It's likely trustworthy enough. I'd give T: 2 or 3? The passage is a review, but not a primary source. But it's about McDonald's. I'd say T: 2. O: combine M and T: maybe 2.

It mentions cumulative distribution function is monotonically increasing. That is an example. But the passage is somewhat garbled: \"If is a random variable, its cumulative distribution function is a monotonically increasing function.\" That is an example. But the passage is not clearly answering \"example of monotonic function\". It gives one example: CDF. But it's not explicit. So relevance: maybe 2? But it's not clear. The passage is about monotonic functions but not giving a clear example. So maybe 1? Let's think.\n\nThe query: \"example of monotonic function\". The passage: mentions CDF as monotonic increasing. That is an example. But the passage is not specifically answering the query. It's more general. So maybe 2? But the passage is somewhat incomplete. The passage is not a perfect answer. So I'd give M=2. Trustworthiness: The passage seems like a snippet from a math text. It's not obviously trustworthy but it's not obviously false. So T=2. O=2? But maybe O=1? Let's decide.\n\nGiven the guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. The passage does mention monotonic functions and gives an example (CDF). So it's somewhat relevant.

The passage: \"In mathematics, a monotonic function (or monotone function) is a function between ordered sets that preserves or reverses the given order. This concept first arose in calculus, and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of order theory. 1 Monotonicity in calculus and analysis.\"\n\nDoes it answer the query? The query: \"example of monotonic function\". The passage defines monotonic function but does not give an example. So it's not fully answering. It's somewhat relevant: it explains what monotonic function is. But not example. So M: maybe 2? Because highly relevant: has some answer but unclear. But it doesn't give example. So maybe 1? The passage is related but does not answer. The query specifically wants example. The passage does not provide example. So M=1. T: trustworthiness? It's a generic definition, likely trustworthy. So T=3. O: overall? We weigh M and T. M low, T high. So overall maybe 2? But guidelines: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O likely between M and T. If M=1, T=3, maybe O=2? But maybe O=1 because content doesn't answer. But trustworthiness high but relevance low. I'd lean O=2? But maybe O=1 because not answer. The example: For query \"anthropological definition of environment\", passage that defines environment in anthropology: M=3, T=3, O=3. For passage that gives definition of anthropological: M=0, T=0, O=0. So O seems to reflect both. If M=1, T=3, O maybe 2? But if M=1, maybe O=1? Let's think: The passage is related but does not answer. So O=1. But trustworthiness high but not relevant. So O=1. I'd choose O=1. So final JSON: {\"M\":1,\"T\":3,\"O\":1}."

Let's analyze.\n\nQuery: \"how are some sharks warm blooded\" (typo: warm blooded). The passage: \"Are sharks cold-blooded or warm-blooded? Sharks have a reputation as 'cold-blooded killers' and despite how negative that term is, it's not entirely inaccurate. Sharks are by no means evil, vicious killers like that quote suggests. Nonetheless, sharks are, for the most part anyways, efficient ectothermic predators. Endo vs Ecto.\"\n\nWe need to evaluate M: match to intent. The query asks how some sharks are warm-blooded. The passage addresses whether sharks are cold-blooded or warm-blooded, but says they are ectothermic (cold-blooded). It doesn't explain how some sharks are warm-blooded. So partially relevant but not answering. So M maybe 1? But the passage does mention the question. It says \"Are sharks cold-blooded or warm-blooded?\" So it addresses the question but doesn't answer. So maybe M=1 (related). T: trustworthiness? The passage seems generic, but not obviously from a reputable source. Might be moderate. But we can assign T=2? But trustworthiness is about the web page. We don't know. But we can guess moderate. O: overall. Since M low, T moderate, overall maybe 1. But we need to decide.\n\nLet's think: The passage is about the question but doesn't answer. So it's related but not answering. So M=1. T: trustworthiness? The passage seems like a generic article, but not obviously from a reputable source. So maybe T=2? But we can set T=2. O: combine: maybe 1. Because M low. So final: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}. But the instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores\" Actually they say \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows JSON object. They say \"Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\". So we output that object. So final answer: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}."

The example shows {\"M\": 3, \"T\": 3, \"O\": 3}. So we output that.\n\nWe need to evaluate the passage for the query \"how are some sharks warm blooded\". The passage: \"Some fish are ectothermic such as the Blue shark whereas others are endothermic such as swordfish and Lamnid sharks.ndothermic = warm-blooded Ectothermic = cold-blooded Endotherms are able to maintain their own body temperature, whereas Ectotherms rely on their environment to regulate body â¦ temperature.\"\n\nWe need to assess M: relevance to query.

So M should be 3.\n\nT: trustworthiness. The passage seems like a snippet from a website, but it's not obviously authoritative. It contains some errors: \"ndothermic\" maybe a typo. But overall it's fairly factual. I'd give T maybe 2? But the instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" We don't have info about source. The passage seems like a snippet from a biology page. I'd give T=2.\n\nO: final score combining M and T. Since M=3, T=2, O likely 2 or 3?

Let's think: M=3, T=2, O=3? But if trustworthiness lower, maybe O=2. The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O should reflect both. M high, T moderate. I'd set O=3?

That is essentially how to find it: find midpoints of legs, connect them. So it does answer the question. It's fairly relevant. So M maybe 2 or 3. The passage is dedicated to the query? It explains the concept, but not step-by-step. The query is \"how to find the midsegment\". The passage says \"A midsegment of a trapezoid is a segment that connects the midpoints of the two non-parallel sides of a trapezoid.\" That is the method. So it's a direct answer. So M=3.\n\nT: trustworthiness. The passage seems like a snippet from some educational text. It mentions \"Key Curriculum Press can provide demo versions of Geometer's Sketch Pad.\" It's not obviously from a reputable source. But it's not obviously false. It's a general geometry fact. So trustworthiness maybe 2. But we can consider 3? The passage is not from a known authority. But it's a factual statement. I'd give T=2.\n\nO: overall. Weighted average? The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O likely between M and T. If M=3, T=2, O maybe 2.5? But we need integer 0-3. So maybe O=2. Because trustworthiness lower. So final: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}.\n\nBut maybe T=3? The passage is factual, no obvious errors. But it's not from a known source. But trustworthiness maybe 3 because it's correct. I'd lean T=3. Then O maybe 3? But if trustworthiness is 3, M=3, O=3. But the passage is not a step-by-step guide, but it does explain how to find it. The question: \"how to find the midsegment of a trapezoid\". The passage: \"A midsegment of a trapezoid is a segment that connects the midpoints of the two non-parallel sides of a trapezoid.\" That is the method. So it's a direct answer. So M=3. T=3. O=3.\n\nBut the passage also mentions \"Key Curriculum Press can provide demo versions of Geometer's Sketch Pad.\" That is extraneous. But still the core answer is there. So I'd give 3 for all.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":3,\"T\":3,\"O\":3}."
