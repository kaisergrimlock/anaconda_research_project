The passage mentions \"human ecology, the broad integrative area of anthropology that focuses on the interactions of culture, biology and the environment.\" It does not give a definition of environment, but mentions environment as part of human ecology. So it's somewhat related but not directly answering. So M (match) maybe 1 (related). T (trustworthiness) the page is from CU Boulder, presumably trustworthy. So T maybe 3. O final maybe 1 or 2? The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).

The passage: \"MSRC's David Rudd Predicts Suicide Rate May Continue Increasing - 2012 military suicides hit a record high of 349. WASHINGTON (AP) – Suicides in the U.S. military surged to a record 349 last year, far exceeding American combat deaths in Afghanistan, and some private experts are predicting the dark trend will grow worse this year.\"\n\nThis passage mentions suicide rate increasing, but does not discuss causes. So it's somewhat related but not answering. So M (match to intent) maybe 1 (related). T (trustworthiness) it's AP news, credible. So T maybe 3. O final maybe 1? But we need to consider relative importance. The passage does not answer causes. So O maybe 1. So produce JSON: {\"M\":1,\"T\":3,\"O\":1}."

The passage contains the answer: \"BSN graduates earn more than RNs with ADN or ASN.\" That is the difference. So it's a perfect answer? The query: \"difference between rn and bsn\" could be about education, responsibilities, salary. The passage focuses on salary difference. So it's partially relevant. I'd give M=2. T: trustworthiness of web page. The passage references Indeed website and BLS. It's somewhat credible but not fully. I'd give T=2. O: final score: maybe 2. So output: {\"M\":2,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}."

Some species live mainly in cold waters, while some others prefer warmer waters. SHARK MIGRATION. One thing is for sure; sharks migrate to find new sources of food and they can travel up to hundreds of miles to do that. Most species of sharks live in the oceans. However, some of them are known to dwell in bodies of freshwater, like the bull shark which travels up to 4,000 Km up the Amazon River.

We need to evaluate the passage relative to query \"is cdg airport in main paris\". The query: \"is cdg airport in main paris\". The user likely wants to know if CDG airport is in main Paris. The passage: \"Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) to Paris by Train. This is an overview of how to travel from Charles de Gaulle-CDG Airport to Central Paris by city train (RER B). For instructions in the opposite direction see Paris to Airport CDG by Train. For step-by-step photo instructions see Terminal 2 to Paris by train or Terminal 1 to Paris by train.\"\n\nThis passage is about traveling from CDG to Paris by train. It does not directly answer whether CDG is in main Paris. It implies that CDG is outside central Paris, but the passage does not explicitly state that. The passage is somewhat relevant: it mentions CDG and Paris. But does it answer the question? The question: \"is cdg airport in main paris\". The passage does not directly answer. It says \"to Central Paris by train\". That implies it's not in central Paris. But it's not explicit. So maybe it's somewhat relevant but not fully answering. So M: 1? Or 2? Let's think: M: measure how well content matches likely intent. The intent: user wants to know if CDG is in main Paris. The passage is about traveling from CDG to Paris. It does not directly answer. So M maybe 1 (related). T: trustworthiness of web page. The passage seems like a travel guide, likely trustworthy. But we don't have info. We can assume moderate trust. So T maybe 2. O: final score: maybe 1? Because content is related but not answering. So final O: 1. So output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}. Ensure no extra text."

It does not give the definition of mechanical ventilation, but it references a policy change regarding continuous invasive mechanical ventilation. The query: \"medicare's definition of mechanical ventilation\". The passage does not provide the definition, but it does mention mechanical ventilation. So it's somewhat related but not answering. So M (match to intent) maybe 1 (related). T (trustworthiness) likely high because CMS. So T maybe 3. O final maybe 1 or 2? The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search.

RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers.

They say \"Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\" That seems contradictory. They want a JSON object with keys M, T, O. The final output should be that object. They also say \"Results {}\" maybe placeholder. But we need to output the scores.\n\nWe need to evaluate the passage relative to query \"rsa definition key\". The passage: \"To generate Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA) key pairs, use the crypto key generate rsa command in global configuration mode.\"\n\nThe query: \"rsa definition key\". The user typed that. The likely intent: They want definition of RSA key? Or definition of RSA? They typed \"rsa definition key\". Could be they want definition of RSA key. The passage gives a command to generate RSA key pairs. It mentions RSA key pairs. It does not give definition. So it's somewhat related but not answering definition. So M (match) maybe 1 (related). T (trustworthiness) maybe 2? The passage seems from a network device manual? It's a command. It's likely trustworthy. But the content is not answering definition. So O maybe 1.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}. But we need to produce JSON array? The instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\"\n\nThey say \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows object. I think they want object. So output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}. No other text."

So M (match) = 3. T (trustworthiness) - we don't know source; but likely a generic definition. Could be moderate. But we can assign 2 maybe. O final = maybe 3? But we need to consider relative importance. M is high, T moderate. Final O maybe 3? But if T is 2, maybe O 2?
