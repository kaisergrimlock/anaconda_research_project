It gives some info. So relevance is high: probably 3 (perfectly relevant) because it directly addresses \"some sharks warm blooded\". It mentions great white sharks are warm-blooded. That's exact answer. So M=3. Trustworthiness: It's a short passage, mentions \"5 people found this useful\". Not a strong source, but likely moderate trust. Could be 2.

RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers.
