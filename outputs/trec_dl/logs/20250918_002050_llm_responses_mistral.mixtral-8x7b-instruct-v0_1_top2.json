Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) can also occur, as can hypertrophy of both ventricles, that is, biventricular hypertrophy (BVH). Ventricular hypertrophy can be part of various syndromes caused by any of various underlying diseases.\nProcess this task in the following steps:\n1. Determine the underlying purpose of the query.\n2. Assess how well the passage aligns with the likely intent of the query (M).\n3. Evaluate the trustworthiness of the passage (T).\n4.

Final score must be an integer value only. Do not provide any code in result. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array.

Instead, it discusses home ventilator prevalence and life-support ventilation, which is only indirectly related to the query. Score: M=1\n3. The passage appears to be a summary of a study or report, so it seems to have some level of trustworthiness. However, without a clear source or author, it's difficult to fully assess its trustworthiness. Score: T=2\n4. Weighing both alignment and trustworthiness, the overall relevance score is lower due to the lack of a direct definition of mechanical ventilation as per Medicare's perspective. Score: O=1\n\nExplanation:\n\n* M=1: The passage is related to the query but does not contain any part of an answer to it.\n* T=2: The passage seems to have some level of trustworthiness, but it's difficult to fully assess without a clear source or author.\n* O=1: The overall relevance score is lower due to the lack of a direct definition of mechanical ventilation as per Medicare's perspective."
