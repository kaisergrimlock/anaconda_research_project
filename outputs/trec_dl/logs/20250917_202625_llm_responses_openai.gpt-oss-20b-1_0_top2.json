The passage: \"Graduate Study in Anthropology. The graduate program in biological anthropology at CU Boulder offers training in several areas, including primatology, human biology, and paleoanthropology. We share an interest in human ecology, the broad integrative area of anthropology that focuses on the interactions of culture, biology and the environment.\"\n\nThe query: \"anthropological definition of environment\". The passage mentions \"human ecology, the broad integrative area of anthropology that focuses on the interactions of culture, biology and the environment.\" It does not give a definition of environment, but mentions environment as part of human ecology. So it's somewhat related but not directly answering. So M (match) maybe 1 (related). T (trustworthiness) the page is from CU Boulder, presumably trustworthy. So T maybe 3. O final maybe 1 or 2? The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O likely weighted by M and T. M low, T high. So O maybe 1.5? But must be integer 0-3. So maybe 1. So final O=1.\n\nThus produce JSON: {\"M\":1,\"T\":3,\"O\":1}."

So it's somewhat related but not answering. So M (match to intent) maybe 1 (related). T (trustworthiness) it's from AP, credible. So T maybe 3. O final maybe 1 or 2? The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).

So it's highly relevant. The passage is short, but it contains the answer. So M (match) should be 3. T (trustworthiness) maybe 2 or 3? It's a generic statement, but not from official source. But it's likely trustworthy. I'd give T=2. O final maybe 3? The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O might be weighted average?

Some species live mainly in cold waters, while some others prefer warmer waters. SHARK MIGRATION. One thing is for sure; sharks migrate to find new sources of food and they can travel up to hundreds of miles to do that. Most species of sharks live in the oceans. However, some of them are known to dwell in bodies of freshwater, like the bull shark which travels up to 4,000 Km up the Amazon River. Sometimes, sharks reach freshwater bodies; this could be the result of the destruction of their habitat by human activities.\nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search.

M is high, T moderate. So O maybe 3? But if T is 2, maybe O 2? The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So we weigh M and T. M=3, T=2. Weighted average maybe 2.5 -> round to 3?

But it's factual. I'd give T=2. M=3. O maybe 3? But if trustworthiness is lower, maybe O=2.5 -> 3? The instruction says integer. I'd choose 3. But maybe they want to reflect trustworthiness.
