The passage is dedicated to cost of interior concrete floors. It contains exact answer: $92 per yard. So M=3. Trustworthiness: It's a company website, presumably. But we don't know source. It's a business statement. Could be trustworthy. But we don't have evidence. We can assign T=2? But guidelines: 3 perfect trustworthiness. 2 highly trustworthy. 1 related. 0 irrelevant.

But if T=2, maybe O=2? But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" not defined. We can assume it's average or something. But we can choose O=3? Let's think: M=3, T=2. O maybe 3?

The price differences between a McDonald’s Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\"\n\nWe need to score M, T, O. M: relevance to query. The passage mentions McDouble and Double Cheeseburger, but it's about price differences, not the difference in composition. The query asks difference between a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger. The passage does mention both, but only in context of price differences. It does not answer the difference in ingredients. So it's partially relevant but not fully. According to guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. This is somewhat related but not answering. So M=1.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage is a review, presumably from a website. It's not a primary source but could be considered somewhat trustworthy. But it's not authoritative. I'd give T=2? But guidelines: trustworthiness: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. But trustworthiness is about source reliability. This is a review, not official. I'd give T=2? Actually trustworthiness: 3 perfect trustworthiness, 2 highly trustworthy, 1 somewhat trustworthy, 0 not trustworthy. This is a review, likely credible but not official. I'd give T=2.\n\nOverall score O: combine? Probably average? But guidelines: overall score is a single integer. We need to decide. The passage is somewhat relevant but not fully, trustworthiness moderate. I'd give O=1? Or maybe 2? Let's think: M=1, T=2. Overall maybe 1? The guidelines don't specify how to compute O. But likely O is overall relevance and trustworthiness. I'd give O=1 because it's not answering the query. So final JSON: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}."

The passage is about ecological anthropology, which is a subfield of anthropology that studies environment's influence. The query: \"anthropological definition of environment\".

But guidelines: trustworthiness: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. But trustworthiness is separate from relevance. We need to assess trustworthiness: is the passage reliable? It's a generic statement, no citations. I'd give T: 2? But maybe 1? The passage is not a definition, but it's a description. Trustworthiness: I'd say 2? But maybe 1 because it's not authoritative. Let's think: The passage is a simple statement, likely from a textbook or article. It's not obviously unreliable. I'd give T: 2. O: overall score: maybe average? But guidelines: overall score is not defined but likely combine M and T. We can choose 1 or 2. I'd choose 1? But if M=1, T=2, overall maybe 1? But we can choose 1.5? But must be integer 0-3.

But incomplete. We can assume moderate trustworthiness? But it's not clear. I'd give T=2? But guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. For trustworthiness, we need to assess source credibility. The passage is incomplete, but likely from a news article. I'd give T=2? But maybe 1? The passage is not fully credible. I'd give T=1?
