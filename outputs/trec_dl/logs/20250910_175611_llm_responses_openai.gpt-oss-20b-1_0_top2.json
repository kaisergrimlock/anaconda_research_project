Passage: about Day's Concrete Floors, Inc, cost per yard of concrete for interior floors: $92 per yard for 3000 psi. So it matches query. It's relevant. Score M: 3? The passage contains the exact answer: cost per yard. The query: cost of interior concrete flooring. The passage gives cost per yard. That is answer. So M=3. Trustworthiness: It's a company statement, not necessarily verified. But it's a direct quote. Could be considered somewhat trustworthy but not verified. Score T: maybe 2? It's a business statement, but not citing sources. So 2. Overall O: maybe average? The guidelines: overall score likely combine M and T. If M=3, T=2, O maybe 3? But guidelines: O is overall score. We can compute maybe average or weighted. But we can decide O=3? But if trustworthiness lower, maybe O=2.5? But must be integer 0-3. I'd choose O=3? But guidelines: \"overall score\" maybe reflect both. I'd choose O=3? But maybe 2? Let's think: M=3, T=2. Overall maybe 3? But if trustworthiness is lower, overall might be 2. I'd choose O=3?

We need to evaluate trustworthiness of passage. It's a factual statement but no source. Might be considered moderately trustworthy. I'd give 2.\n\nOverall O: combine? Probably average or weighted. We can compute average of M and T? But guidelines: overall score. We can consider overall as average of M and T. M=3, T=2 => average 2.5 => round? They didn't specify rounding. But scores must be integer 0-3. So maybe we round to nearest integer: 3? Or floor? Not specified. But we can choose 3? But maybe 2? Let's think: overall should reflect both relevance and trustworthiness. If M=3, T=2, overall maybe 3? But that would overstate trustworthiness. Maybe 2? Let's choose 3?

The query is specifically \"anthropological definition of environment\". The passage does not provide a definition of environment itself, but gives a definition of cultural ecology that includes environment. So it's somewhat related but not directly answering. So M=1. Trustworthiness: The passage cites a known anthropologist Julian Steward, 1955 book. It's likely trustworthy. So T=3? But we need to consider trustworthiness: The passage is from K. Kris Hirst, presumably a scholar. It's a definition. So trustworthiness high. So T=3. Overall: combine M and T. If M=1, T=3, overall maybe 2? The guidelines: overall score likely weighted.

Passage: \"Suicide surpassed war as the military's leading cause of death. War was the leading cause of death in the military nearly every year between 2004 and 2011 until suicides became the top means dying for in 2012 and 2013, according to a bar chart published this week in a. Post to Facebook.\"\n\nWe need to score intent match M: Does passage answer query? Query: causes of military suicide. Passage mentions that suicide surpassed war as leading cause of death, but does not list causes. It gives trend. So it's somewhat related but not answering causes. So M=1 (related). Trustworthiness T: The passage references a bar chart published this week in a. Post to Facebook. It's unclear source, maybe not trustworthy. So T=1 (related). Overall O: combine? Likely average? But guidelines: overall score maybe reflect both. I'd give O=1. So output: [{\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}]. Ensure JSON array."
