The passage gives cost per yard for interior floors. So it's a direct answer. So M=3.\n\nT: Trustworthiness. It's a company statement. It's presumably trustworthy? It's a direct quote from a company. There's no source verification. But it's likely trustworthy. But we can give 2 or 3. The guidelines: 3: Perfectly relevant.

Usually O = average or something? The guidelines don't specify how to compute O. We need to produce a score. We can maybe average M and T? But we need to produce an integer 0-3.

If the tank is not large enough to allow the goldfish to grow, it's growth will be stunted and this can cause the fish to become unhealthy and die. The fancy goldfish do not get as large as the common/comet/shubunkin/feeder goldfish.\"\n\nWe need to score:\n\nM: Intent match. Query: \"do goldfish grow\". Passage: yes, it says goldfish will grow to depth of water, etc. So it's relevant. It's not exactly the answer? The query is simple: do goldfish grow? The passage says yes, they grow to depth of water, etc. So it's a direct answer. So M=3.\n\nT: Trustworthiness. The passage seems factual, but we don't know source. It's likely trustworthy. But we can't guarantee. But we can assign 2 or 3. The guidelines: 3: Perfectly relevant. 2: Highly relevant. 1: Related. 0: Irrelevant. For trustworthiness, we need to evaluate if the passage is trustworthy. It's a factual statement. I'd give 2 or 3. I'd lean 2 because we don't know source. But maybe 3. The guidelines don't specify trustworthiness scale. But we can interpret: 3: Perfectly trustworthy. 2: Highly trustworthy. 1: Related. 0: Irrelevant. So I'd give 2.\n\nO: Overall score. Usually average or weighted? We can compute average of M and T? But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" but not defined. We can maybe average M and T. M=3, T=2 => average 2.5 => round? But integer 0-3. We can round to nearest integer: 3? Or maybe we can compute (M+T)/2 and round down? Not specified. We can choose 3? But maybe 2? Let's think: The passage is highly relevant and somewhat trustworthy. So overall maybe 3? But if trustworthiness is 2, overall maybe 2.5 => 3? I'd choose 3? But we need integer. I'd choose 3? But maybe 2? Let's decide: The passage is definitely relevant and fairly trustworthy. I'd give overall 3. But if we want to be conservative, 2.5 => 3. I'd go with 3.\n\nThus output: [{\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}]."

                  "text": "We need to produce JSON array of objects for each passage. There's only one passage given. We need to evaluate M, T, O. The query: \"causes of military suicide\". Passage: \"Suicide surpassed war as the military's leading cause of death. War was the leading cause of death in the military nearly every year between 2004 and 2011 until suicides became the top means dying for in 2012 and 2013, according to a bar chart published this week in a. Post to Facebook.\"\n\nWe need to evaluate relevance: The passage mentions suicide as leading cause of death, but does not list causes of military suicide. The query is \"causes of military suicide\". The passage does not provide causes, just that suicide surpassed war. So it's related but does not answer. So M=1. Trustworthiness: The passage references a bar chart published this week in a. Post to Facebook. It's unclear source, maybe not trustworthy. So T=1? Could be 0? It's not a reliable source. But it's a statement. I'd give T=1. Overall O: combine M and T. Since M=1, T=1, overall maybe 1. So output: [{\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}]. Ensure JSON array."
