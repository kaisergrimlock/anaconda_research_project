The price differences between a McDonald’s Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\"\n\nWe need to score M, T, O. M: relevance to query. The passage mentions McDouble and Double Cheeseburger, but it's about price differences, not the difference in composition. The query asks difference between a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger. The passage does mention both, but only in context of price differences. It does not answer the difference in ingredients. So it's partially relevant but not fully. According to guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. This is somewhat related but not answering. So M=1.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage is a review, presumably from a website. It's not a primary source but likely trustworthy. But we don't have evidence of reliability. It's a review, but it's about price differences. It's likely trustworthy. I'd give T=2? But guidelines: 3 perfect trustworthiness, 2 highly trustworthy, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. The passage is a review, presumably credible. I'd say T=2.\n\nOverall score O: combine? Probably average? But guidelines: overall score is a single integer. We need to decide. Usually overall is a combination of M and T. If M=1, T=2, overall maybe 1? But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" but no explicit formula. We can choose a moderate. I'd set O=1.5? But must be integer 0-3. So maybe O=1. Because M is low. So O=1.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}."

Does it answer the query? The query is \"do goldfish grow\". The passage says \"A goldfish will grow to the depth of the water it is kept in.\" So yes, it answers. So M=3.\n\nTrustworthiness: T. The passage seems factual, but we don't know source. It's a general statement. It's likely trustworthy. But we can't guarantee. But it's not obviously false. So T=2 or 3? The guidelines: 3 perfect trustworthiness. 2 highly trustworthy. 1 related. 0 irrelevant. The passage seems credible. I'd give T=2. O: overall score. Usually average or weighted? The guidelines don't specify formula. We can consider O as average of M and T? But we can just give a score that reflects overall. Since M=3, T=2, overall maybe 3? But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" maybe combine. I'd give O=3? But maybe 2.5? But must be integer 0-3. I'd choose O=3? But if trustworthiness is 2, overall might be 2.5 but round? I'd choose 3? But maybe 2? Let's think: The passage is relevant and somewhat trustworthy. I'd give overall 3? But guidelines: 3: Perfectly relevant. The passage is dedicated to the query and contains the exact answer. It does contain the answer. So overall 3. But trustworthiness is 2. But overall can be 3. The guidelines don't say overall must be less than or equal to min of M and T. So we can give 3. I'll give O=3.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}."
