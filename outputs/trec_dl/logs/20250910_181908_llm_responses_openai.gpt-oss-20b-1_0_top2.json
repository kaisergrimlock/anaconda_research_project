The passage contains cost of interior concrete flooring: $92 per yard for 3000 psi. So it's relevant. It's not exactly the answer? The query: cost of interior concrete flooring. The passage gives cost per yard. That is an answer. So M=3.\n\nT: Trustworthiness. It's a company statement. It's presumably trustworthy? It's a direct statement of cost. But we don't know if it's accurate. But it's a primary source. I'd give 2 maybe. But guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. For trustworthiness, we need to evaluate if the passage is trustworthy. It's a company statement. Might be reliable. I'd give 2.\n\nO: Overall score. Usually average or weighted? We need to produce a single integer 0-3. We can compute average of M and T? But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" but no formula. We can choose a score that reflects overall.

But guidelines: overall score is a measure of overall relevance and trustworthiness. If M=3 and T=2, overall maybe 3? But maybe 2? I'd lean 3 because it's highly relevant and fairly trustworthy. But trustworthiness is not perfect. But overall could be 3? The guidelines don't specify how to combine. I'd set O=3? But maybe 2? Let's decide: I'd set O=3 because it's a perfect answer. But trustworthiness is not perfect. But overall might be 3? The example: \"If a passage or the query is empty or not a string, use null.\" Not relevant. So we produce array with one object: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}. But maybe O=2? Let's think: The passage is a definition, but no source. So trustworthiness is not perfect. But overall could be 2?

The price differences between a McDonald’s Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\"\n\nWe need to score M, T, O. M: relevance to query. The passage mentions McDouble and Double Cheeseburger, but it's about price differences, not the difference in composition. The query asks difference between a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger. The passage does mention both, but only in context of price differences. It does not answer the difference in ingredients. So it's partially relevant but not fully. According to guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. This is somewhat related but not answering. So M=1.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage is a review, presumably from a website. It's a review of Triple Cheeseburger, but mentions price differences. It's likely trustworthy? It's a review, but not necessarily authoritative. But it's a review, not a fact-check. The passage is not obviously unreliable. So T=2? But guidelines: trustworthiness: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. We need to evaluate trustworthiness. The passage is a review, but not necessarily authoritative. But it's not obviously false. I'd give T=2.\n\nOverall score O: combine M and T. Usually O is some function. But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\" but no formula. We can maybe average? But we need integer 0-3. We can choose 1 or 2. Since M=1, T=2, overall maybe 1? But maybe 2? The passage is somewhat relevant but not fully. I'd set O=1.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}."
