First, let's make sure you are using the right estimator for your project, here's a quick primer on concrete staining.\"\n\nSo passage is about cost of interior concrete flooring, specifically staining. It contains the phrase \"cost of interior concrete flooring\" and mentions pricing. So it's relevant. The answer: The passage is dedicated to the query and contains the exact answer? It says \"we will go over some of the options that are available for concrete staining for interior floors and the pricing for them.\" It doesn't give actual numbers but indicates pricing. So it's somewhat relevant but not fully answer. So M: 2 (highly relevant). T: trustworthiness? It's a website about concrete staining. Might be moderately trustworthy. So T: 2. O: 2.\n\nThus output: {\"M\": 2, \"T\": 2, \"O\": 2}."

So M (match) should be 3. Trustworthiness T? It's not clear if it's trustworthy. It's a generic description of a website. Might be moderately trustworthy. But we can assign 2. O final: maybe 3? But we need to consider relative importance. The passage is directly relevant. So O maybe 3. But T is 2. So final O maybe 3? The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So we weigh M and T. M=3, T=2. So O maybe 3? Or maybe 2? If trustworthiness is lower, maybe O=2. But the passage is fairly relevant. I'd lean O=3. But we need to decide. The passage is dedicated to query, contains exact answer? It says \"Find out average prices and what design features contribute to the cost of concrete flooring.\" That is an answer. So 3. So O=3. Provide JSON object: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}."

Might be confusion. They want a JSON object with keys M, T, O. Provide scores 0-3. We need to evaluate the passage for query \"causes of left ventricular hypertrophy\". The passage is about right ventricular hypertrophy, but mentions \"causes of left ventricular hypertrophy then pumped back to the left ventricle\". It does not provide causes of left ventricular hypertrophy. So it's not relevant. So M=0. Trustworthiness? The passage seems generic, but not trustworthy. T=0. O=0.
