But we don't know source. Could be 2? But trustworthiness maybe 2? But we can assign 2? But the passage is not authoritative. I'd give T=2? But maybe 1? The passage is generic, but not a definition. So trustworthiness maybe 2? But we can set T=2. O final maybe 1? Because M=1, T=2, but overall relevance low. So O=1. So output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}."

The axons are what conduct action potentials away from the cell body. The axon is not an axon because it’s long, it’s an axon because of the existence of synaptic knobs at the axon terminals. When the axon conducts action potentials away from the cell body and the signal goes to the synaptic knob, it’s going to release a neurotransmitter in response to the electrical signal.\"\n\nWe need to evaluate M: match to query. The passage does define synaptic knobs at axon terminals, but not a clear definition. It says \"synaptic knobs at the axon terminals\" and explains that they release neurotransmitter. So it's somewhat relevant. M maybe 2 (highly relevant). T: trustworthiness? The passage seems like a snippet from a biology text, but not sure. It's not obviously from a reputable source.

TERMINAL BUTTON: The terminal button is commonly referred to as the synaptic button, end button, button terminal, terminal bulb, and synaptic knob..\"\n\nQuery: \"axon terminals or synaptic knob definition\"\n\nWe need to evaluate M: match to query. The passage defines terminal part of axon, synaptic knob synonyms. So it's highly relevant. M=3? The passage contains the definition. It says \"the terminal part of an axon from which a neural signal is rendered, via dispersion of a neurotransmitter, across a synapse to a nearby neuron.\" That is definition. Also synonyms. So M=3.\n\nT: trustworthiness. The passage seems like a snippet from a website, maybe a dictionary or biology site. It's not obviously from a reputable source. But it's a definition. The passage is short, but likely from a biology resource. We might assign T=2? But the instructions: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" We don't have info about source. The passage includes date \"April 29, 2013.\" Might be from a blog or wiki. Could be moderately trustworthy. I'd give T=2.\n\nO: overall. Considering M=3, T=2, overall likely 3? But if trustworthiness is lower, maybe overall 2. The guidelines: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" M is high, T moderate. I'd lean O=3 because the passage is directly relevant. But if trustworthiness is low, maybe O=2. The passage is a definition, but we don't know source. I'd give O=3? The example: if passage is definition, they gave O=3. So O=3.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}."

But the instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" The passage is a definition of AIRMET, but we don't know source. Could be trustworthy. But we can assign T=2 or 3.

But it's not explicit. The passage is somewhat relevant but not fully answering. So M maybe 2? But it's not a clear answer. Might be 1? The passage is related but not answering. The question: difference between a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger. The passage mentions price difference and cheese slices. That is a difference. So it's somewhat relevant. I'd give M=2. T: trustworthiness of web page. It's a blog or forum style, not authoritative. So T=1. O: overall. We weigh M more. So maybe O=2? But if T is low, maybe O=1?

The example shows {\"M\": 3, \"T\": 3, \"O\": 3}. So we output that.\n\nWe need to evaluate the passage for the query \"do goldfish grow\". The passage: \"If the tank is not large enough to allow the goldfish to grow, it's growth will be stunted and this can cause the fish to become unhealthy and die. The fancy goldfish do not get as large as the common/comet/shubunkin/feeder goldfish. The more room you can give your goldfish, the faster it will grow.\"\n\nWe need to consider M: relevance to query. The query: \"do goldfish grow\". The passage addresses growth of goldfish, mentions that they grow, but growth depends on tank size. So it is highly relevant. So M=2? The passage contains answer: yes, goldfish grow, but growth can be stunted. So it's a direct answer. So M=3? The passage is dedicated to the query and contains the exact answer. It says \"If the tank is not large enough to allow the goldfish to grow, it's growth will be stunted\". It also says \"The more room you can give your goldfish, the faster it will grow.\" So it answers the question. So M=3.\n\nT: trustworthiness. The passage seems like a typical aquarium advice. No source given. But it's plausible. We might assign T=2? But the instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" We don't have source. So maybe moderate trust. So T=2.\n\nO: final score. We weigh M and T. M=3, T=2. So O maybe 3? Or maybe 2? The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" Usually M is more important. So O=3.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}."

But the passage is not obviously from a reputable source. So T maybe 1. O: overall: maybe 1 or 2. Let's think: M=2, T=1, O maybe 1? But if M high but T low, overall maybe 1. But the instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O is final. If M=2, T=1, O maybe 1? But maybe O=2? Let's decide: The passage is somewhat relevant but not perfect. So O=2? But trustworthiness low might reduce. I'd set O=1. But maybe they want O=2 because M high. Let's think: The passage is a definition, but inaccurate. The query is \"exons definition biology\". The passage gives a definition. So M=2. T=1. O maybe 1.5? But must be integer 0-3. So choose 1. So final: {\"M\":2,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}."

The passage explains what the midsegment is, its properties, but does not give step-by-step instructions on how to find it. It says it's the segment connecting midpoints of non-parallel sides. That is essentially how to find it: find midpoints of legs, connect them. So it does answer the question. It's fairly relevant. So M maybe 2 or 3. The passage is dedicated to the query, contains the answer. It says \"midsegment is a segment that connects the midpoints of the two non-parallel sides\". That is the method. So M=3.\n\nT: trustworthiness. The passage seems like a math explanation, but includes \"Key Curriculum Press can provide demo versions of Geometer's Sketch Pad.\" It's not obviously from a reputable source. But it's a math explanation. Might be moderately trustworthy. I'd give T=2.\n\nO: final score. Weighted average? The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search.

But missing dividing by 2? Actually midsegment length is average of bases: (a+b)/2. The passage incorrectly says sum of bases? It says 9+45=54. That is sum, not average. So it's inaccurate. But still relevant. The query: \"how to find the midsegment of a trapezoid\". The passage provides some answer but incomplete/incorrect. So M: 2 (highly relevant). T: trustworthiness? The passage seems like a snippet from a math explanation, but the calculation is wrong. So trustworthiness maybe 1? But it's not obviously from a reputable source. So T: 1. O: combine: maybe 1?

If M=2, T=1, O maybe 1? But maybe O=2? Let's think: The passage is somewhat relevant but contains errors. So overall usefulness is limited. I'd give O=1. But maybe they want O=2 because it's highly relevant but not fully correct. The trustworthiness is low, but still some answer. I'd lean O=1. But let's examine guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. The passage is highly relevant but not perfect. So M=2. Trustworthiness: maybe 1 because of error. O: maybe 1? But if M=2 and T=1, O might be 1 or 2. The relative importance: M likely more important. So O maybe 2. But trustworthiness reduces. I'd choose O=1?

So M likely 1 (related but not answer). T: trustworthiness: CMS is a trustworthy source. So T maybe 3. O: overall: combine M and T. Since M low, overall maybe 1.

The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O is overall. If M=3, T=2, overall maybe 3? But if trustworthiness is lower, maybe 2. But the passage seems fairly accurate. I'd give O=3. But maybe they want O=3 if M=3 and T=2? The relative importance: M likely more important. So O=3.

The food of the Swiss is unusual in that it has so many regional influences from the cuisine of its neighbors. This includes the French, German and Italians. Historically, Switzerland was a farming country, and the most popular crops and foods include cheese and potatoes as well as chocolate.\" So it does mention cheese, potatoes, chocolate. The query: \"what is the most popular food in switzerland\". The passage gives some answer: cheese, potatoes, chocolate. It says \"most popular crops and foods include cheese and potatoes as well as chocolate.\" So it does answer. So M=3. Trustworthiness? The passage seems like a generic description, but not obviously from a reliable source. But it's not obviously false. We can assign T=2 maybe. But the instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" We don't have source info. The passage seems like a generic description, maybe from Wikipedia. I'd give T=2. O final: combine M and T. Since M=3, T=2, O maybe 3? The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" Usually O is final relevance. If M high and T moderate, O maybe 3? But if T low, maybe 2. I'd lean O=3 because the passage is relevant and contains answer. So output: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}."
