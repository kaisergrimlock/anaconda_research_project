The passage describes Theraderm Skin Renewal System, its purpose: total skincare system, reduce fine lines, rough skin, sun damage. That answers what it's used for (anti-aging skincare). So relevance is high. Probably M=3 (perfectly relevant) because it directly says what it's used for. Trustworthiness: passage mentions low scores on consumer sites, some doubt. Might be moderate trustworthiness, maybe 2. Overall O maybe combine: high relevance but moderate trust, overall maybe 2 or 3? Probably O=2 (since trust lower). But the instruction: \"Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).
