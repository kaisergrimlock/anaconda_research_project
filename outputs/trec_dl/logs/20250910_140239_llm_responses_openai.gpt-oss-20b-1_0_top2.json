Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) can also occur, as can hypertrophy of both ventricles, that is, biventricular hypertrophy (BVH). Ventricular hypertrophy can be part of various syndromes caused by any of various underlying diseases.\nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search.

It says \"Ventricular hypertrophy can be part of various syndromes caused by any of various underlying diseases.\" That is vague. So the passage partially addresses the query but not fully. So M (match) maybe 2 (highly relevant). T (trustworthiness) unknown; but it's a generic passage, maybe 3? But we don't have info. We can assume moderate trustworthiness, maybe 3? But we need to decide. The passage is likely from a medical source? Not sure. But we can assign T=3? But maybe 2? The instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" We don't have info. We can guess 3? But we might choose 2. Let's think: The passage is generic, no source. So trustworthiness uncertain. I'd give T=2. So O maybe 2. So final JSON: {\"M\": 2, \"T\": 2, \"O\": 2}."
