The concrete cost per yard of concrete is $92.00 for 3000 3/4 psi concrete and $100.00 for 4000 3/4 psi concrete.\"\n\nWe need to score:\n\nM: Intent match. The passage contains cost of interior concrete flooring: $92 per yard for 3000 psi. So it's relevant. It's not exactly the answer? The query: \"cost of interior concrete flooring\". The passage gives cost per yard. That is the answer. So M=3.\n\nT: Trustworthiness. It's a company statement. It's presumably trustworthy? It's a direct statement of cost. But we don't know if it's accurate. But it's a primary source. I'd give 2 maybe. But guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. For trustworthiness, we need to evaluate if the passage is trustworthy. It's a company statement. It's likely trustworthy. I'd give 2. But maybe 3? The passage is a direct statement of cost. It's not citing sources. But it's a primary source. I'd give 2.\n\nO: Overall score. Usually average or something. But we need to produce a single integer 0-3. We can compute average of M and T? But guidelines: \"overall score (O)\". We need to decide. Usually overall is maybe average of M and T. But we can decide. Let's compute average: (3+2)/2=2.5. Round? We need integer 0-3. We could round to nearest integer: 3? Or floor: 2? The guidelines don't specify. But we can choose 3? But maybe 2.5 rounds to 3. But we can also choose 2. I'd choose 3? But we need to be consistent. Let's think: The passage is highly relevant and fairly trustworthy. So overall maybe 3. But if we consider trustworthiness less than perfect, overall maybe 2.5 -> 3. I'd choose 3.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":3}."

M: relevance to query. The passage mentions McDouble and Double Cheeseburger, but it's about price differences, not the difference in composition.

So M=1.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage is a review, presumably from a website. It's not a primary source but likely trustworthy. But we don't have evidence of reliability. It's a review, but it's about price differences. It's likely trustworthy. I'd give T=2? But guidelines: 3 perfect trustworthiness, 2 highly trustworthy, 1 related, 0 irrelevant.

But trustworthiness is separate from relevance. We need to assess trustworthiness: Is the passage credible? It's a generic statement, but no source. I'd give 2? But maybe 1? The passage is not obviously from a reputable source. But it's a factual statement. I'd give 2. O: overall score: combine? Probably average? But guidelines: overall score is a single integer. We need to decide. Usually overall is maybe average of M and T? But we can decide. Let's think: M=1, T=2. Overall maybe 1? Or 2? The guidelines don't specify how to compute O.
