The query: \"anthropological definition of environment\". The passage does not define environment. So it's not a perfect answer. It's somewhat related. So M=1. Trustworthiness: The passage cites K.

The query is \"causes of military suicide\". The passage does not provide causes, just that suicide is leading cause. So it's related but not answering. So M=1. Trustworthiness: The passage seems to be from a bar chart published this week in a. It's likely credible but incomplete. We can give T=2? But trustworthiness is about reliability of information. It's a snippet, but likely from a reputable source. But we don't know. I'd give T=2. Overall O: combine M and T. Since M=1, T=2, overall maybe 1? The guidelines: O is overall score. We can compute maybe average? But guidelines don't specify formula. We can choose O=1.5? But must be integer 0-3. I'd choose O=1. So final JSON array: [{\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}]."

The passage is dedicated to the query and contains the exact answer.\n- 2: Highly relevant. The passage contains some answer, but it may be unclear or mixed with extraneous information.\n- 1: Related. The passage is on-topic but does not answer the query.\n- 0: Irrelevant. The passage is not related to the query.\n- Evaluate every single passage; do not leave any items unscored or blank.\n- Always assume you are preparing a report based on the topic from the query.\n- Consider the user's intent as expressed by their search and methodically assess each passage.\n- Input Parameters:\n- `query`: A non-empty string representing the user's search query.\n- `passages`: An array of non-empty strings, with each string as a passage to be evaluated.\n- Output:\n- JSON array of objects, each corresponding to a passage (order preserved).\n- Each object format: { \"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score } where each score is an integer from 0 to 3.\nA person has typed \"causes of military suicide\" into a search engine.\nConsider the following passage: Suicide surpassed war as the military's leading cause of death. War was the leading cause of death in the military nearly every year between 2004 and 2011 until suicides became the top means dying for in 2012 and 2013, according to a bar chart published this week in a. Post to Facebook.\n- If a passage or the query is empty or not a string, use null for each score in that object: { \"M\": null, \"T\": null, \"O\": null }.\n- Output array length and order must match the input `passages` array.\n- Do not output any reasoning or commentary—only the JSON array.\nExample: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}",
