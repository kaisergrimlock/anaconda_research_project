They say \"Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\" That seems contradictory. They want a JSON object with keys M, T, O. The final output should be that object. So we need to produce something like {\"M\": 0, \"T\": 0, \"O\": 0} maybe.\n\nWe need to evaluate the passage: \"BURGER KING® Bacon Cheeseburger Deluxe, Bacon Double Cheeseburger, Bacon Cheeseburger, Double Cheeseburger VALUE Menu\". The query: \"difference between a mcdouble and a double cheeseburger\". The passage is about Burger King burgers, not McDonald's. So it's irrelevant. So M=0. Trustworthiness T? The passage is from Burger King, presumably trustworthy? But it's irrelevant. So T maybe 0 or 1? The passage is a product listing, likely trustworthy. But since it's irrelevant, we might still give T=1? But the instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" The passage is from Burger King, presumably trustworthy. So T=1. But the final O: combine M and T. Since M=0, O=0. So final: {\"M\":0,\"T\":1,\"O\":0}. But maybe they want 0 for all? The passage is irrelevant, so M=0. T maybe 0 because it's not relevant? But trustworthiness is independent. The passage is from a brand, so trustworthiness high. But the instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O is final relevance. So O=0. So we output {\"M\":0,\"T\":1,\"O\":0}. That seems plausible.\n\nBut the example: \"Results {}\" maybe they want an array? The instruction: \"Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\"\n\nIt says \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows JSON object.

With all else equal, RNs with BSN degrees receive higher salaries than those with ASN or ADN degrees.n 2011, ADNs earned about $64,000 on average while BSNs made $76,000.

The passage: \"Biological Anthropology. The graduate program in biological anthropology at CU Boulder offers training in several areas, including primatology, human biology, and paleoanthropology. We share an interest in human ecology, the broad integrative area of anthropology that focuses on the interactions of culture, biology and the environment.\"\n\nThe query: \"anthropological definition of environment\". The passage mentions \"human ecology\" and \"interactions of culture, biology and the environment\". It does not give a definition of environment. So it's somewhat related but not answering. So M (match) maybe 1. T (trustworthiness) maybe 2? The page is from CU Boulder, presumably trustworthy. But the passage is not directly answering. So O maybe 1. So produce JSON: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}. Ensure no extra text."

Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O). Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}",

Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score} Results {}\"\n\nIt says \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows JSON object. Might be confusion. They want a JSON object with keys M, T, O. Provide scores 0-3. We need to evaluate the passage relative to query \"causes of military suicide\". The passage gives suicide rates, not causes. So it's not answering the query. It's related but not answering. So M (match to intent) maybe 1 (related). T (trustworthiness) the data is from Pentagon, presumably trustworthy. So T maybe 3. O final maybe average? They said consider relative importance. Likely M more important. So O maybe 1 or 2? Since M=1, T=3, maybe O=1? But maybe O=2? Let's think: The passage is about rates, not causes. So it's not relevant to causes. So O=1. Provide JSON: {\"M\":1,\"T\":3,\"O\":1}."
