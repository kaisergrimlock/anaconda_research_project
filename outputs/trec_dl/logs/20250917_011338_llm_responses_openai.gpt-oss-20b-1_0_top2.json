The passage is about definition of AIRMET, mentions compare sigmet. So it's somewhat related but not directly definition of sigmet. So M (match) maybe 1 (related). T (trustworthiness) unknown; but it's a snippet from a website maybe. Could be moderate trust. Let's assign T=2? But we need to decide. The passage is a definition of AIRMET, not sigmet. So it's not directly answering. So M=1. T maybe 2? But we can set T=2. O final maybe 1? Because overall relevance low. But we can weigh M more. Let's set O=1. So JSON: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}."

For example, consider our initial example f(x) equals x 2.\" That is indeed a non-monotonic function. So the passage does not provide an example of monotonic function; it gives an example of non-monotonic. So it's not answering the query. It's somewhat related but not answering. So score M: 1 (related). T: trustworthiness? The passage seems generic, no source. But we can assume moderate trust? Probably 2? But trustworthiness is separate. The passage is not obviously from a trustworthy source. But we can assign 2? Actually trustworthiness: 2 for highly trustworthy? The passage is generic, no citations. I'd give 2? But maybe 1? The instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" We don't know. I'd give 2? But maybe 1. Let's think: The passage is a snippet, no source. I'd give 1. So M=1, T=1, O=1? But O is final score combining M and T. The passage is related but not answering. So overall 1. So output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}."

It does not explain mechanism, but indicates that some sharks can elevate body temperature. So it's somewhat relevant but not fully answering. So M (match) maybe 2. T (trustworthiness) unknown; passage seems plausible but not authoritative. Could be 2. O final maybe 2. So output: {\"M\":2,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}. Ensure no extra text."

The phrase \"JSON array of scores\" maybe means a JSON object with keys M, T, O. The example shows that. So we output {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score}. We need to evaluate the passage relative to query \"is cdg airport in main paris\". The query: \"is cdg airport in main paris\". The user likely wants to know if CDG airport is in main Paris. The passage: \"Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) to Paris by Train. This is an overview of how to travel from Charles de Gaulle-CDG Airport to Central Paris by city train (RER B). For instructions in the opposite direction see Paris to Airport CDG by Train. For step-by-step photo instructions see Terminal 2 to Paris by train or Terminal 1 to Paris by train.\"\n\nThis passage is about traveling from CDG to Paris by train. It does not directly answer whether CDG is in main Paris. It implies that CDG is outside central Paris, but the passage does not explicitly state that. The passage is somewhat relevant: it mentions CDG and Paris. But the answer to the query is not directly given. So M: maybe 1 or 2? The passage is somewhat related but not answering. So M=1. T: trustworthiness? It's likely from a travel guide, but we don't know. But it's likely trustworthy. So T=2? But we can assign 2. O: overall? Probably 1. So output {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}."
