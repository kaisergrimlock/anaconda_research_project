Passage: \"Review: Triple Cheeseburger from McDonald’s. When it comes to the various sizes of classic McDonald’s cheeseburgers, the prices might have you scratching your head. The price differences between a McDonald’s Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\"\n\nWe need to score M, T, O. M: relevance to query. The passage mentions McDouble and Double Cheeseburger, but it's about price differences, not the difference in composition. The query asks difference between a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger. The passage does mention both, but only in context of price differences. It does not answer the difference in ingredients. So it's partially relevant but not fully. According to guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. This is somewhat related but not answering. So M=1.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage is a review, presumably from a website. It's not a primary source but likely trustworthy. But we don't have evidence of reliability. It's a review, but it's about price differences. It's likely trustworthy. I'd give T=2? But guidelines: 3 perfect trustworthiness, 2 highly trustworthy, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. The passage is a review, not a primary source, but it's likely credible. I'd give T=2.\n\nOverall score O: combine M and T. Usually O is overall relevance and trustworthiness. If M=1, T=2, overall maybe 1? But guidelines: O is overall score. We can compute average? But guidelines don't specify formula. We can choose O=1 or 2. Since M is low, overall low. I'd set O=1.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":2,\"O\":1}."

Does it answer the query? The query is \"do goldfish grow\". The passage says \"A goldfish will grow to the depth of the water it is kept in.\" So yes, it answers. So M=3.\n\nTrustworthiness: The passage seems factual, but we don't know source. It's likely trustworthy. But we can't guarantee. But it's a straightforward statement. I'd give T=2 or 3? The guidelines: 3 perfect trustworthiness. 2 highly trustworthy. 1 related. 0 irrelevant. The passage seems credible. I'd give T=2 or 3. I'd lean 2 because we don't know source. But it's a simple factual statement. I'd give T=2.\n\nOverall score O: combine M and T. Usually O is overall. If M=3 and T=2, O maybe 2? But guidelines: O is overall score. We can compute average? Not specified. But we can choose a score that reflects both. I'd give O=2.5? But must be integer 0-3. So maybe 2. I'd choose O=2.\n\nThus output: {\"M\":3,\"T\":2,\"O\":2}."

The passage mentions LVH and that it can be part of various syndromes caused by underlying diseases. It does not list specific causes. The query is \"causes of left ventricular hypertrophy\". The passage partially addresses that LVH can be part of various syndromes caused by underlying diseases, but does not list them. So it's somewhat relevant but not fully answering. According to guidelines: 3 perfect, 2 highly relevant, 1 related, 0 irrelevant. This is somewhat relevant but not answering. So M=2? Or maybe 1? The passage does mention that LVH can be part of various syndromes caused by underlying diseases. That is a partial answer. So I'd say M=2 (highly relevant). T: trustworthiness. The passage seems like a general description, likely from a medical source. It's neutral, no obvious bias. So T=3? But we don't know source. But it's a factual description. I'd give T=3. O: overall score. Usually average of M and T? But guidelines: overall score is a combined measure. We can compute average? But we need integer 0-3. If M=2, T=3, average 2.5 => round? Probably 3? But guidelines don't specify. We can choose 3? But maybe 2? Let's think: overall score should reflect both. If M=2, T=3, overall maybe 2? Because relevance is lower. I'd choose O=2.
