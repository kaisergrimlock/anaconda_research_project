The passage mentions suicides but not causes. It's not directly answering. So relevance low. M: 1? It's somewhat related but not answer. T: trustworthiness? Not sure. The passage seems like a statement, but no source. So maybe T: 1? But we need to decide. The instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" We don't have info. So maybe 1. O: overall: 1. So output {\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}. But maybe M: 1, T: 0? But we can guess. The passage is not directly answering. So M: 1. T: 1? I'd go with 1. So final JSON."
