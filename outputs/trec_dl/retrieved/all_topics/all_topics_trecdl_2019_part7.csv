how to find the midsegment of a trapezoid,1394087,"The segment EF, joining midpoints E and F of the lateral sides, is called a midline of a trapezoid. A midline of a trapezoid is equal to a half-sum of bases: and parallel to them: EF || AD and EF || BC. A trapezoid with equal lateral sides ( AB = CD ) is called an isoscelestrapezoid. In an isosceles trapezoid angles by each base, are equal ( A = D, B = C ). A parallelogram can be considered as a particular case of trapezoid. Midline of a triangle is a segment, joining midpoints of lateral sides of a triangle.",2
