causes of left ventricular hypertrophy,8332555,"What is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)? The right and left sides of your heart do different jobs. The right side takes in blood that has travelled round the body and pumps it to the lungs. From here, the blood enters the left side of the heart from where it is pumped all round your body. Because the left side of the heart has to work harder to get blood round your body, it is usually this side that becomes enlarged when your blood pressure is too high. This is sometimes called left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH for short. In other words, it is another name for an enlarged heart. People with high blood pressure and an enlarged left side of the heart have four times the risk of a heart attack than someone with the same blood pressure but a normal-sized heart.",2

causes of left ventricular hypertrophy,8522403,"In this condition, the walls of both the left and right side of the heart (ventricles) become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of cardiomegaly, the heart's large muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. Hypertrophy is usually what causes left ventricular enlargement.",1
causes of left ventricular hypertrophy,8534130,"See the Mayo Clinic webpage Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Itâs the thickening of the muscle of the left ventricle, usually because pumping against a higher resistance (hypertension, aortic valve defects) or as part of a hereditary heart muscle disease (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).

causes of left ventricular hypertrophy,8534134,"Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) occurs when the muscle tissue in the heartâs main pumping chamber becomes enlarged.

causes of left ventricular hypertrophy,8683185,"Several underlying conditions can contribute to or influence the enlargement of the heart muscle in the left ventricle. Hypertension is the most common cause, setting the stage for left ventricular hypertrophy once a personâs blood pressure exceeds the normal level of 140/90 mm Hg.

If you have high blood pressure, this means that your heart has to work harder to push blood round your body. To cope with this extra effort, your heart muscles become thicker and stiffer, which can make the heart become enlarged. An enlarged heart will not pump as well as it should, and this can cause you problems.",0
