Doc 1: 8434623 (rel=2, score=24.384)
Passage:
{
  "id" : "8434623",
  "contents" : "There is a discernible difference between the two burgers, especially in the meat quality. The McDouble contains gristle and carry's a different flavor than the Double Cheeseburger. The double cheeseburger tastes more like beef. The McDouble tastes of whatever meat filler they use to fill the gap."

{
  "id" : "744165",
  "contents" : "Review: Triple Cheeseburger from McDonaldâs. When it comes to the various sizes of classic McDonaldâs cheeseburgers, the prices might have you scratching your head. The price differences between a McDonaldâs Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another."

Doc 4: 8434619 (rel=2, score=20.646)
Passage:
{
  "id" : "8434619",
  "contents" : "At first glance, the double cheeseburger looks a lot like the McDouble, but it is not exactly the same thing. The main difference that you will notice is the amount of cheese that is on this sandwich. There are two slices of cheese on the double cheeseburger instead of just the one slice of cheese that comes on the McDouble. Even though it comes with two slices of cheese, it still has the onions, pickles, ketchup and mustard that come on the other burgers."

Doc 5: 8434626 (rel=2, score=20.457)
Passage:
{
  "id" : "8434626",
  "contents" : "But I did it for you. With McDonald's recent release of the McDouble, they now have three basic, sub-$2 cheeseburgers: the cheeseburger, McDouble (two patties with one slice of cheese), and double cheeseburger (two patties with two slices of cheese)."
}

Doc 6: 8434618 (rel=2, score=17.750)
Passage:
{
  "id" : "8434618",
  "contents" : "The Double Cheesburger is now $1.19 instead of a buck. Seriously, $.19/slice of cheese and a removal from the Dollar Menu. Do I order the Double Cheeseburger at its new full price or do I stick to the Dollar Menu and go with the McDouble. Of course, I go with the McDouble. One piece of McCheese might be better than two pieces of McCheese. I guess McDonalds thinks people like me who bought the Double Cheeseburger for a buck will pony up and pay the extra pennies. Sooner or later they will be charging for extra napkins and ketchup."

Doc 8: 744167 (rel=0, score=17.239)
Passage:
{
  "id" : "744167",
  "contents" : "The Double Cheeseburger is priced at $1.49 and my Triple Cheeseburger was priced at $2.19. I just donât understand the point of paying 70-cents for an extra burger patty when you can just get two McDoubles for $2.00. Obviously the value of the Triple Cheeseburger makes no sense when youâre comparing menu items."
