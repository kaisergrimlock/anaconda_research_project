The passage is about medication for tension headaches, not about treating tension headaches without medication. The query: \"treating tension headaches without medication\". The passage is about muscle relaxants, opioids, medication. So it's irrelevant to the query. So M (match) should be 0. T (trustworthiness) maybe 0 or 1? The passage is not relevant, but trustworthiness? The passage seems to be from some medical site but includes some questionable content. But trustworthiness is about the page's trustworthiness, not relevance. But the passage is not relevant. But we still need to give a trustworthiness score. The passage seems to be a snippet from a medical website, but includes some questionable claims. But we can assign a moderate trustworthiness maybe 0.5? But the instructions: \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1\" So integer 0 or 1. So trustworthiness either 0 or 1. The passage is not obviously trustworthy? It's a medical snippet but includes some questionable claims. But we can assign 0? But maybe 1? The passage is from a medical site, but includes some questionable claims. But we can assign 0.5? But integer only. So we need to decide. The passage is not relevant, but trustworthiness might be 1 because it's from a medical site. But the snippet includes some questionable claims. But we can assign 0. Let's think: The passage is about medication, not about non-medication. So it's irrelevant. So M=0. T: trustworthiness of the page. The snippet includes some claims about opioids, but it's not obviously disallowed. It's a medical snippet. I'd lean 1. But the instructions: \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1 with the following meanings: 1 for relevant: The passage is relevant to the query and answer it perfectly. 0 for irrelevant: The passage has nothing to do with the query.\" That is for the overall score? Wait, the initial instruction: \"Given a query and a passage, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 1 with the following meanings: 1 for relevant: The passage is relevant to the query and answer it perfectly. 0 for irrelevant: The passage has nothing to do with the query.\" That is for the final score O. But then they ask to split into steps: M, T, O. So M is match, T is trustworthiness, O is final. So O should be 0 because it's irrelevant. M should be 0. T maybe 1? But trustworthiness is about the page's trustworthiness. The snippet is from a medical site, but includes some questionable claims. But we can assign 1. So final JSON: {\"M\":0,\"T\":1,\"O\":0}. That seems plausible. Let's produce that."

This passage partially addresses self-treatment but mentions OTC pain relievers, which are medication. The query is about treating without medication. Passage says some try to treat on their own, but also mentions OTC pain relievers. It's somewhat relevant but not fully. I'd say M=1? The passage addresses self-treatment but not specifically non-medication. Might be partially relevant. But we need binary. I'd lean 1 because it mentions self-treatment. Trustworthiness? Not enough info. Could be 0. But trustworthiness maybe 0.5? But integer. I'd set T=0. O maybe 1? But if trustworthiness low, overall maybe 0. But they want final score O. I'd set O=0. Because not fully relevant and trustworthiness uncertain. But maybe they want 1. Let's decide: The passage is somewhat relevant but not perfect. The query is \"treating tension headaches without medication\". Passage says some people try to treat pain on their own, but also mentions OTC pain relievers. That is medication.

Passage says tension headaches respond well to medication and rest. It mentions rest but not other non-medication. It says respond well to medication and rest. So rest is non-medication. But passage does not give details. The query: \"treating tension headaches without medication\". The passage mentions rest as a treatment, but not other methods. So partially relevant? But the passage is about tension headaches in children, not necessarily non-medication. It says respond well to medication and rest. So rest is a non-medication approach. So some relevance. But does it answer query? It doesn't give details. But the passage does mention rest as a non-medication approach. So maybe moderate relevance. But we need binary 0 or 1. I'd lean 1? But maybe 0 because not enough info. The instruction: \"relevant: The passage is relevant to the query and answer it perfectly.\" The passage does not answer query perfectly. So maybe 0. Trustworthiness: The passage seems factual but not necessarily trustworthy? It's a generic statement. Could be trustworthy. But we need to decide. M: relevance. I'd say 0. T: trustworthiness. I'd say 1? But maybe 0? The passage is generic but not citing sources. But trustworthiness maybe 0? But we need to decide. The instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" The passage is not obviously from a trustworthy source. So maybe 0. So O: final score. If M=0, T=0, O maybe 0.

The passage does not mention non-medication. So maybe relevance is low. But the passage is about TMJ dentist, 30 years, treating TMJ and related symptoms. It might be relevant because it addresses tension headaches. But the query is specifically about non-medication. The passage does not mention that. So maybe M=0. Trustworthiness: The passage claims 30 years experience, but no source. Could be somewhat trustworthy. But we need to decide. I'd set T=1 maybe because it's from a dentist with 30 years.

We need to evaluate the passage relative to query \"treating tension headaches without medication\". The passage: \"Management of tension-type headaches focuses in the short term on treating acute attacks, and in the long term on preventing recurrent episodes of headache.\" This is somewhat relevant: it mentions management of tension-type headaches, short term treating acute attacks, long term preventing recurrent episodes. It doesn't mention medication or non-medication. But still relevant to query about treating tension headaches. The query is about treating tension headaches without medication. The passage does not mention medication or non-medication. So relevance maybe moderate? But the passage is about management, but not specifically non-medication. So M maybe 0.5? But they want integer 0 or 1? They said \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1\". So 0 or 1. So we need to decide if relevant or not. The passage is somewhat relevant but not specifically about non-medication. The query: \"treating tension headaches without medication\". The passage: \"Management of tension-type headaches focuses in the short term on treating acute attacks, and in the long term on preventing recurrent episodes of headache.\" This is general management, could include medication or non-medication. But does it answer the query? It doesn't mention non-medication. So maybe not fully relevant. I'd lean 0. But maybe 1? The passage is about management of tension-type headaches, which is relevant to the query. But the query is specifically about non-medication. The passage doesn't mention that. So I'd say irrelevant. So M=0. T: trustworthiness of web page? We don't have info. Assume unknown, maybe 0.5? But integer 0 or 1. We can guess 0? But trustworthiness maybe 1? Hard. But we can set T=0.5? But must be integer. So maybe 0. But we can set T=0.5? No. Must be integer 0 or 1. I'd set T=0.5? Not allowed. So maybe 0. But we can set T=1? But we don't know. I'd set T=0.5? Not allowed.

Query: \"treating tension headaches without medication\". The passage mentions feverfew, a natural remedy, so relevant. So M=1. T: trustworthiness of web page. We don't know source. The passage seems generic, but no source. Might be moderate trust. But we need binary. I'd lean 0? But maybe 1? The passage claims medicinal benefits, but no citations. Might be questionable. But we can assume moderate trust? The instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" Without source, uncertain. I'd set T=0. O: overall. Combine M and T. If M=1 and T=0, overall maybe 0? But maybe still relevant enough? The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" If trustworthiness low, overall maybe 0. So O=0.

The passage: \"Back to Top Treatment ». The goal is to treat your headache symptoms right away, and to prevent headaches by avoiding or changing your triggers. A key step in doing this involves learning to manage your tension headaches at home by: 1 Keeping a headache diary to help you identify your headache triggers.\"\n\nWe need to evaluate relevance to query \"treating tension headaches without medication\". The passage mentions treating headache symptoms, preventing headaches by avoiding triggers, learning to manage tension headaches at home, keeping a headache diary. It does not mention medication. So it is relevant to non-medication treatment. So M (match) high. T (trustworthiness) unknown. The passage seems generic, maybe from a health website. We can assign moderate trust. Let's say M=1, T=0.5? But they want integer? They said \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1\". So integer 0 or 1. So we must give 0 or 1. So M=1, T=1? But trustworthiness uncertain. But we can assume it's trustworthy? The passage seems generic. I'd give T=1? But maybe 0? The instruction: \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1\". So each score is 0 or 1. So we need to decide. The passage is relevant, so M=1. Trustworthiness: we don't know, but likely moderate. But we can set T=1? But maybe 0? The passage is generic, but not obviously from a reputable source. But we can assume it's from a health website. I'd set T=1. Then O (overall) maybe 1. So output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":1,\"O\":1}."
