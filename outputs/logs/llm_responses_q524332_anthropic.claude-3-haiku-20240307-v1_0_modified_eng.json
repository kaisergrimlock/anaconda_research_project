With a tension headache, the pain often starts at the back of your head and moves forward, so that it eventually includes your neck, scalp, and head.auses. Researchers aren't clear what  treating tension headaches without medication   causes a tension headache. For years, scientists thought that it was caused by tightening the muscles in your shoulders, neck, scalp, and jaw when you are tense. But new tests that measure muscle tension show that the muscles of people with tension headaches arenât any tighter.\nSplit this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search.
