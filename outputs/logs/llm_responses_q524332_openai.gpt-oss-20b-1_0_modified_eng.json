The passage is somewhat garbled but includes the phrase. So relevance: The passage contains the phrase, but does it answer the query? The query is about how to treat tension headaches without medication. The passage says they are usually treated with OTC medications, not necessarily without medication.

It says \"treated with antinausea drugs and abortive or prev treating tension headaches without medication entive medications.\" That seems contradictory. But it does mention \"treating tension headaches without medication\". So relevance is maybe 1. Trustworthiness? The passage seems like a generic overview, but not necessarily trustworthy.

The query is about treating tension headaches without medication. The passage includes mention of medication, but also includes the phrase \"treating tension headaches without medication\" as part of the text. But does it provide relevant info? The passage is not very relevant: it mentions eye strain triggers tension headaches, cluster headaches, and medication. It does not give non-medication treatments. So M (match) likely 0.

Maxalt should not be used to treat a common tension headache, a headache that causes loss of movement on one side of your body, or any headach  treating tension headaches without medication  e that seems to be different from your usual migraine headaches.\"\n\nThis passage mentions tension headaches and medication. It says Maxalt should not be used to treat tension headache. It also mentions \"treating tension headaches without medication\" but not giving methods. So relevance? The query is about treating tension headaches without medication. The passage is about medication not being used, but does not provide non-medication treatments. So relevance is low. Might be partially relevant because it mentions tension headaches and medication. But the query is about non-medication treatments. The passage does not provide that. So relevance maybe 0. Trustworthiness? The passage seems like a snippet from a medical site, but unclear. Could be trustworthy? But we need to decide. The passage is not providing info on non-medication treatments. So M=0. T maybe 1? But trustworthiness is about the web page. The snippet seems like a medical site, but we don't know. Could be trustworthy. But we need to decide. The instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" We don't have info. But we can guess moderate trust. But we need integer 0 or 1. I'd set T=1 maybe. But final O? They want final score combining M and T. If M=0, O likely 0. So output: {\"M\":0,\"T\":1,\"O\":0}. But maybe T=0 too? But trustworthiness uncertain. But we can set T=0? The snippet is not obviously trustworthy. But we can guess 0. But final O would be 0 anyway. So either T=0 or 1. Let's choose T=0 because we don't know. So final: {\"M\":0,\"T\":0,\"O\":0}."

The passage is about pregnancy headaches, mentions medication, but also says \"prevent or relieve mild headaches during pregnancy without taking medication\". It is somewhat relevant but not directly about tension headaches. The passage is partially relevant.
