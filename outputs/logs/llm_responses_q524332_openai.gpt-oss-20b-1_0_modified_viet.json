The passage: \"Tension headaches are the most common type of primary headache and usually are treated with over-the-counter (OTC) medications for pain. Secondary headaches are a symptom of Điều trị đau đầu do căng thẳng mà không dùng thuốc an injury or an underlying illness.\" The passage mentions treatment with OTC meds, not medication-free. Also includes Vietnamese phrase \"Điều trị đau đầu do căng thẳng mà không dùng thuốc\" which translates to \"treatment of tension headaches without medication\". So the passage partially addresses the query. But the first sentence says usually treated with OTC meds. The second sentence includes Vietnamese phrase about treatment without medication. So relevance? The query is \"treating tension headaches without medication\". The passage includes that phrase, but also says usually treated with OTC meds. The passage is somewhat relevant but not fully. We need to decide M: relevance. I'd say 1 because it contains the phrase. T: trustworthiness? The passage seems like a snippet from a website, but no source. Hard to judge. I'd give 0 for trustworthiness. O: final score maybe average? They said consider relative importance. Probably M more important. So O maybe 1? But trustworthiness low. Maybe O=0? Let's think: The passage is partially relevant but not fully. The query is specifically about non-medication treatment. The passage says usually treated with OTC meds, but also includes Vietnamese phrase about treatment without medication. So it's somewhat relevant. I'd give M=1. Trustworthiness uncertain, maybe 0. Final O maybe 0.5? But must be integer 0 or 1. If trustworthiness low, maybe O=0. But if relevance high, maybe O=1. Which is more important? The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" Hard to gauge. I'd lean that relevance is key. So O=1.

They said \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1\" meaning 0 or 1. So each score is 0 or 1. We need to evaluate the passage for relevance to query \"treating tension headaches without medication\". The passage: \"Tension headache Tension headaches, caused by muscle tension, are marked by pain, pressure and tightness around the head. Medication reaction or side-effect Medication side effects include nausea, vomiting, st Điều trị đau đầu do căng thẳng mà không dùng thuốc omach upset, weakness, dizziness, seizures, and more.\"\n\nThe passage mentions tension headaches, side effects of medication, and includes Vietnamese phrase \"Điều trị đau đầu do căng thẳng mà không dùng thuốc\" which translates to \"Treating tension headaches without medication\". So the passage does mention the topic. But the passage is incomplete, garbled. It does mention \"treating tension headaches without medication\" in Vietnamese. So relevance is likely 1. Trustworthiness? The passage seems like a snippet from a website, but we don't know trustworthiness. It's not obviously trustworthy. But we need to assign T. We can guess 0 or 1. The passage is not obviously from a reputable source. So maybe 0. But the instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" We don't have info. We might assign 0. So M=1, T=0, O? The final score O is relative importance. We need to decide final score. If M=1 and T=0, maybe O=0? But maybe O is weighted average? They didn't specify formula. We need to decide. The passage is relevant but not trustworthy. The final score might be 0 because trustworthiness matters. But maybe they want 1 if relevant. Hard to know. The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So we need to weigh M and T. If trustworthiness is low, maybe final is 0.

So relevance is high. M: 1. T: trustworthiness? The passage seems partially garbled, includes Vietnamese phrase \"Điều trị đau đầu do căng thẳng mà không dùng thuốc\" meaning \"treating tension headaches without medication\". It's a mix of English and Vietnamese, maybe from a website. Trustworthiness uncertain. But likely moderate. We can assign T=0.5? But they want integer 0 or 1? They said \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1\". So integer 0 or 1. So we need to decide if trustworthiness is 1 or 0. The passage is somewhat garbled, but still contains relevant info. I'd say trustworthiness maybe 0? But it's not obviously trustworthy. But the question: \"Given a query and a passage, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 1 with the following meanings: 1 for relevant: The passage is relevant to the query and answer it perfectly. 0 for irrelevant: The passage has nothing to do with the query.\" That is for overall relevance. But they also ask to measure M, T, O. M: measure how well content matches likely intent. T: trustworthiness. O: final score. They want integer 0 or 1 for each? They said \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1\". So each score is 0 or 1. So M likely 1. T maybe 0? But if we consider trustworthiness, the passage is partially garbled, but still contains relevant info. I'd lean 1 for trustworthiness? But it's not obviously trustworthy. But maybe we can assign 0.5? But must be integer. So choose 0? But that would lower O. O is final score. We need to consider relative importance. M likely more important. So O maybe 1. So we can set M=1, T=0, O=1. That seems plausible. Let's produce JSON: {\"M\":1,\"T\":0,\"O\":1}."

They said \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1\" meaning 0 or 1. So each score is 0 or 1. We need to evaluate the passage for relevance to query \"treating tension headaches without medication\". The passage says: \"Do not take more than 5 capsules in 12 hours to treat a migraine, or 8 capsules in 24 hours to treat a tension headache. Ask a doctor or  Điều trị đau đầu do căng thẳng mà không dùng thuốc pharmacist before using any other pain, cold, allergy, or sleep medication. Acetaminophen (sometimes abbreviated as APAP) is contained in many combination medicines.\"\n\nThis passage includes mention of medication, dosage, and also \"Điều trị đau đầu do căng thẳng mà không dùng thuốc\" which is Vietnamese for \"treat tension headache without medication\". So it partially addresses the query. But the passage is about medication dosage, not non-medication treatments. The query is \"treating tension headaches without medication\". The passage includes a phrase \"điều trị đau đầu do căng thẳng mà không dùng thuốc\" which is exactly \"treat tension headache without medication\". So it is somewhat relevant. But the rest of the passage is about medication. The question: \"Given a query and a passage, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 1 with the following meanings: 1 for relevant: The passage is relevant to the query and answer it perfectly. 0 for irrelevant: The passage has nothing to do with the query.\" So is the passage relevant? It contains a phrase that matches the query. But does it answer it perfectly? No, it doesn't provide non-medication methods. So maybe it's partially relevant but not perfect. The instruction says 1 for relevant: The passage is relevant to the query and answer it perfectly. So if it doesn't answer perfectly, maybe it's not 1. So maybe 0. But we need to decide. The passage is not fully relevant. It mentions medication. So I'd lean 0. But we also need to produce M, T, O. M: measure how well content matches likely intent. That is maybe 0. T: trustworthiness of web page. Hard to gauge. The passage seems like a snippet from a medical site, but includes Vietnamese phrase. Might be low trust. So maybe 0. O: final score. Probably 0.

Passage: \"Tension headaches are very common, unfortunately, they're also among the most neglected and difficult headaches to treat Điều trị đau đầu do căng thẳng mà không dùng thuốc . With a tension headache, the pain often starts at the back of your head and moves forward, so that it eventually includes your neck, scalp, and head.auses. Researchers aren't clear what causes a tension headache. For years, scientists thought that it was caused by tightening the muscles in your shoulders, neck, scalp, and jaw when you are tense. But new tests that measure muscle tension show that the muscles of people with tension headaches aren’t any tighter.\"\n\nThe passage mentions \"Điều trị đau đầu do căng thẳng mà không dùng thuốc\" which is Vietnamese for \"treating tension headaches without medication\". So it addresses the query. So M=1. Trustworthiness? The passage seems generic, no source, but it's a snippet. Might be from a website. Hard to judge. But likely not highly trustworthy. But we need to decide. The passage is not obviously from a reputable source. So T maybe 0. But overall O? They said consider relative importance. Usually relevance is more important. So O maybe 1? But if trustworthiness low, maybe overall 0? The instruction: \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So we need to weigh M and T. If M=1, T=0, maybe O=0? But maybe still 1 because relevant. But trustworthiness might reduce overall. I'd lean O=0 because trustworthiness low. But maybe they want 1 if relevant. Hard.\n\nGiven typical evaluation, if content is relevant but not trustworthy, overall might be 0. But the instruction: \"Assume that you are writing a report on the subject of the topic.\" So you need trustworthy info. So maybe O=0. I'll output: {\"M\":1,\"T\":0,\"O\":0}."

They say \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows object. Probably they want object with keys M, T, O. Provide integer scores 0 or 1? They said \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1\" meaning 0 or 1. So each of M, T, O should be 0 or 1. We need to evaluate the passage relative to query \"treating tension headaches without medication\". The passage mentions tension headaches, home remedies include rest and OTC medications. It does mention \"treating tension headaches without medication\" but also says OTC medications. The query is about treating tension headaches without medication. The passage does mention home remedies like rest, but also OTC meds. So partially relevant. But the passage is about classification of headaches, not specifically about non-medication treatments. It does mention rest as a home remedy. So maybe relevant? The passage is somewhat relevant but not perfect. The question: \"Given a query and a passage, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 1 with the following meanings: 1 for relevant: The passage is relevant to the query and answer it perfectly. 0 for irrelevant: The passage has nothing to do with the query.\" So we need to decide if passage is relevant. It does mention tension headaches and home remedies like rest. That addresses the query partially. But does it answer it perfectly? No. So maybe 0? But the passage does mention \"treating tension headaches without medication\" in Vietnamese? The passage includes Vietnamese phrase \"Điều trị đau đầu do căng thẳng mà không dùng thuốc\" which means \"treating tension headaches without medication\". So the passage explicitly includes that phrase. So it is relevant. But does it answer the query? It says home remedies include rest and OTC meds. It doesn't give non-medication methods beyond rest. But the query is \"treating tension headaches without medication\". The passage includes that phrase. So maybe it's relevant enough. I'd lean 1 for relevance. Trustworthiness: The passage seems like a snippet from a medical article, but includes some Vietnamese text. It's not obviously trustworthy. But we need to assign T. Trustworthiness maybe 0? But we need to decide. The passage is not obviously from a reputable source. So T maybe 0. M: relevance maybe 1. O: final maybe average? They said consider relative importance. Usually relevance is more important. So O maybe 1? But if T is 0, maybe O 0? But they want a final score. I'd set O = 1? But if trustworthiness is low, maybe O 0. But the passage is partially relevant. I'd set M=1, T=0, O=0? But they want integer 0 or 1. I'd choose O=0 because trustworthiness low. But maybe they want O=1 if relevance high. Hard.\n\nGiven the instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So we need to weigh M and T. If M=1, T=0, maybe O=0? Because trustworthiness matters. I'd set O=0. So final JSON: {\"M\":1,\"T\":0,\"O\":0}."

So it is relevant. So M=1. Trustworthiness T: The passage seems like a medical website but not sure. It references doctors, but also includes random content. Might be questionable. But trustworthiness maybe 0? But we need to decide. The passage is not obviously trustworthy. But it's a medical site? It says \"Suggested Reading on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder by Our Doctors.\" Might be a medical site. But the content is messy. I'd lean T=0. O final: maybe average? They said consider relative importance. Usually relevance is more important. So O maybe 1? But if trustworthiness low, maybe 0. But they want binary. I'd set O=1 if M=1 and T=0? But they said consider relative importance. Hard. I'd set O=1 because relevance is high. But trustworthiness low might reduce. I'd set O=0? Let's think: The passage is relevant but not trustworthy.

The query is about how to treat tension headaches without medication. The passage only mentions that phrase but not instructions. So maybe partially relevant. But the instruction: \"relevant: The passage is relevant to the query and answer it perfectly.\" It does not answer perfectly. So maybe not fully relevant. But we need binary.

The following drugs and medications are in some way related to Điều trị đau đầu do căng thẳng mà không dùng thuốc , or used in the treatment of this condition.\" That is Vietnamese phrase meaning \"treatment of tension headaches without medication\". So passage is about medications, but also references that phrase. The query is about treating tension headaches without medication. The passage is about medications, but also references the phrase. The passage is not directly providing non-medication treatments. So relevance is low. But does it answer query? It says medications are related to the condition, but query is about non-medication. So not relevant. So M=0. Trustworthiness? The passage seems generic, but not necessarily trustworthy. But we can set T=0. Final O=0. Provide JSON object."
