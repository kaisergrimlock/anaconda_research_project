Actually example shows an object: {\"M\": score, \"T\": score, \"O\": score}. They say \"JSON array of scores\" but example is object. We'll follow example: produce JSON object with keys M, T, O. Scores are integers? They said \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1\". So 0 or 1. So we need to evaluate M, T, O.\n\nWe have passage: \"Tension headache Tension headaches, caused by muscle tension, are marked by pain, pressure and tightness around the head.  treating tension headaches without medication   Medication reaction or side-effect Medication side effects include nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, weakness, dizziness, seizures, and more.\"\n\nQuery: \"treating tension headaches without medication\"\n\nWe need to evaluate:\n\nM: measure how well content matches likely intent of query. The passage includes \"treating tension headaches without medication\" phrase. But the passage also includes medication side effects. The passage is somewhat relevant but not providing actual treatment methods. It mentions the phrase but not content. So maybe partially relevant. But we need binary? They said \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1\" but not necessarily binary? They said \"1 for relevant: The passage is relevant to the query and answer it perfectly. 0 for irrelevant: The passage has nothing to do with the query.\" So we need to decide if it's relevant or not. The passage does mention the phrase \"treating tension headaches without medication\" but does not provide actual methods. It also includes medication side effects. So does it answer the query? No. So maybe not relevant. So M=0.\n\nT: trustworthiness of web page. We don't have info. The passage seems generic, maybe from a medical site? But we can't assume. So maybe 0.\n\nO: final score. If both M and T are 0, O likely 0. So output {\"M\":0,\"T\":0,\"O\":0}.\n\nBut we need to produce JSON array? They said \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows object. We'll output object.\n\nThus final answer: {\"M\":0,\"T\":0,\"O\":0}"

The passage is not relevant, so overall O: 0. So output: {\"M\":0,\"T\":0,\"O\":0} or maybe T: 1? But trustworthiness of the page: It's a medical snippet, but we can't judge.

So M=1. Trustworthiness? The passage seems poorly written, maybe from a low-quality source. But trustworthiness maybe low. But we need to decide. The passage is not obviously trustworthy. So T=0. Final O maybe weighted? They said consider relative importance. Usually relevance is more important. So O maybe 1? But if trustworthiness is low, maybe O=0? The instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So we need to decide O. If M=1, T=0, maybe O=0? But maybe still 1 because content is relevant. But trustworthiness might reduce final score. I'd lean O=0 because low trustworthiness. But maybe they want 1 if relevant. Hard to guess. Let's think: The passage is relevant but not trustworthy. The final score might be 0 because not trustworthy. But the instruction: \"strictly binary true or false question where relevant is 1 and irrelevant is 0.\" That refers to overall relevance? They said \"1 for relevant: The passage is relevant to the query and answer it perfectly. 0 for irrelevant: The passage has nothing to do with the query.\" So overall relevance is 1. So O should be 1. But they also ask to measure trustworthiness. But final O is overall relevance? They say \"Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O is final relevance? Might incorporate trustworthiness. But the earlier definition of 1/0 is for relevance. So trustworthiness is separate. So O likely is relevance. So O=1. So M=1, T=0, O=1. Let's output JSON object."

The passage mentions tension headaches and says \"treating tension headaches without medication\" but the passage is incomplete and seems to be about causes. It does mention \"treating tension headaches without medication\" but not giving methods. So does it answer query? It partially mentions but not provide solutions. So relevance maybe low.

The passage: \"Tension headaches are very common, unfortun treating tension headaches without medication ately, they're also among the most neglected and difficult headaches to treat.\" It doesn't give treatment. So relevance maybe 0. Trustworthiness? The passage seems poorly written, maybe not trustworthy. So T=0. So O=0. So output: {\"M\":0,\"T\":0,\"O\":0}. Ensure no extra text."

The passage is about treating tension headaches without medication during pregnancy. It mentions medication but also says \"prevent or relieve mild headaches during pregnancy without taking medication\". So it partially addresses the query. But the passage is about pregnancy, not general tension headaches. The query is general. The passage is somewhat relevant but not perfect. The passage is not fully relevant. So M maybe 0.5? But they want integer 0 or 1? The instruction: \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1 with the following meanings: 1 for relevant: The passage is relevant to the query and answer it perfectly. 0 for irrelevant: The passage has nothing to do with the query.\" So we need to output 0 or 1. So we need to decide if it's relevant or not. The passage does mention tension headaches and non-medication. But it's specifically about pregnancy. The query is general. The passage partially addresses but not fully. I'd lean that it's not fully relevant. So 0. But maybe they consider it relevant because it addresses tension headaches without medication. But the passage is about pregnancy. The query didn't mention pregnancy. So I'd say irrelevant. So M=0. T: trustworthiness? The passage seems like a snippet from a health website.

They say \"JSON array of scores\" but example shows object. Probably they want object with keys M, T, O. Provide integer scores 0 or 1? They said \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1\". So each score is 0 or 1. Evaluate M: relevance to query. T: trustworthiness. O: overall. The passage: \"1 A neurotransmitter, serotonin, is thought to be involved in migraines because many of the drugs used to treat migraines alter the binding of serotonin to various receptors. Tension - Tension headaches ar treating tension headaches without medication e caused by muscular strains in the head and neck and/or emotional stress.\"\n\nThe passage mentions tension headaches and treating them without medication. So relevance is high. So M=1. Trustworthiness: The passage seems like a snippet from a medical article? It mentions serotonin and migraines. It's somewhat credible but not sure. But likely moderate trustworthiness. But we need integer 0 or 1. I'd say trustworthiness maybe 1? But could be 0 if uncertain. The passage is not obviously from a reputable source. But it's a snippet. I'd lean 1? But maybe 0? The instruction: \"Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).\" We don't have source. I'd guess 0? But we need to decide. The passage is not obviously from a reputable source. I'd set T=0. O: overall. If M=1 and T=0, overall maybe 0? But maybe still 1? The overall should reflect both. I'd set O=0. So JSON: {\"M\":1,\"T\":0,\"O\":0}."
