It mentions tension-type headaches, short term acute attacks, long term prevention. It doesn't explicitly mention medication or non-medication. But the query is about treating tension headaches without medication. The passage is about management but not specifying medication. It might be relevant because it discusses management of tension-type headaches, but not specifically non-medication. The passage is somewhat relevant but incomplete. We need to decide M: relevance to query. I'd say 1? Because it addresses tension headaches management. But does it answer \"without medication\"? Not explicitly. But could be considered partially relevant. The instruction: \"The passage is relevant to the query and answer it perfectly\" for 1. This passage does not answer perfectly. So maybe 0. But maybe they want 1 if relevant at all. The passage is about tension headaches management, but not specifically medication. The query is about non-medication.

The passage does not mention medication or non-medication. It mentions dentist might treat them. That could be considered relevant? But the passage is not perfect.

Headaches during pregnancy are common. However, if you develop a severe headache or a headache ...\"\n\nThe query: \"treating tension headaches without medication\". The passage is about preventing or relieving mild headaches during pregnancy without medication, but also mentions medication. It's partially relevant: it addresses tension headaches? It says \"cách điều trị chừng đau đầu do căng thẳng\" which is Vietnamese for \"how to treat mild tension headaches\". So it is somewhat relevant. But the passage is about pregnancy. The query is general. The passage mentions medication but also says \"without taking medication\" at the start. So it's partially relevant. But the passage is not fully relevant. The question: \"Given a query and a passage, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 1 with the following meanings: 1 for relevant: The passage is relevant to the query and answer it perfectly. 0 for irrelevant: The passage has nothing to do with the query.\" So we need to decide if it's relevant or not. The passage does mention tension headaches and non-medication methods. So it's relevant. But the passage also mentions medication. But the query is \"treating tension headaches without medication\". The passage says \"try the following: ... keep in mind that most pregnant women can safely take acetaminophen ...\". So it does mention medication. But the passage also says \"without taking medication\" at the start. So it's partially relevant. But the question: \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1\" So we need to output 1 or 0. The passage is relevant enough? I'd say yes, it's relevant. So output 1. But we also need M, T, O. M: measure how well content matches likely intent. I'd say 1. T: trustworthiness of web page. The passage seems like a snippet from a health website, but not sure. I'd say 0.5? But we need integer? The instruction says \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1\". But M, T, O are separate scores. They didn't specify integer for M, T, O. But earlier they said \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1\". So each score should be 0 or 1. So M: 1, T: 0? But trustworthiness? The passage is not obviously trustworthy. But we can set T: 0. O: final score: maybe 1? But if trustworthiness is low, maybe O: 0? But the instruction: \"Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O).\" So O is final relevance. If M=1, T=0, maybe O=0? But if trustworthiness is low, maybe still relevant. But the final score should reflect overall relevance. The passage is relevant but not trustworthy. But the question: \"score on an integer scale of 0 to 1 with the following meanings: 1 for relevant: The passage is relevant to the query and answer it perfectly. 0 for irrelevant: The passage has nothing to do with the query.\" So we need to decide if it's relevant. I'd say yes. So O=1. M=1, T=0? But trustworthiness maybe 0. But we can set T=0. So final JSON: {\"M\":1,\"T\":0,\"O\":1}. That seems plausible."

The passage does mention tension headache and \"cách điều trị\" which is \"how to treat\". So it's somewhat relevant. But does it answer the query \"treating tension headaches without medication\"? The passage does not mention non-medication. So maybe not fully relevant. But it's still about tension headaches. The query is about non-medication. The passage is about tension headaches but not specifically non-medication. So maybe it's partially relevant but not fully. The instruction: \"1 for relevant: The passage is relevant to the query and answer it perfectly. 0 for irrelevant: The passage has nothing to do with the query.\" So it's not perfect. So maybe 0. But we need to decide. I'd lean 0 because it doesn't answer the query. So M=0. T? Trustworthiness: unknown. Might be a medical site. But we can't be sure. I'd give 0.5? But integer only. So maybe 0. So O=0. So final JSON: {\"M\":0,\"T\":0,\"O\":0}."

But does it mention treatment without medication? It says \"cách điều trị chừng đau đầu do căng thẳng\" which is Vietnamese for \"how to treat tension headaches\". Might include non-medication? Not clear. But likely some mention of treatment. But passage is incomplete. It doesn't explicitly mention medication or non-medication. But it says \"cách điều trị\" which could be methods. So maybe partially relevant. But we need binary. I'd lean 1 for relevance? But trustworthiness? The passage seems incomplete, maybe from a website. Hard to gauge trustworthiness. I'd set T=0. M=1. O maybe average? They said consider relative importance. Usually relevance more important. So O maybe 1? But if trustworthiness low, maybe 0. But they want final score. I'd set O=0? But if M=1 and T=0, maybe O=0? But they said relative importance. Hard. I'd choose O=0.5? But must be integer 0 or 1. I'd choose 0? But that would say overall irrelevant. But passage does mention tension headaches. I'd say overall relevant. So O=1. Provide JSON: {\"M\":1,\"T\":0,\"O\":1}."
