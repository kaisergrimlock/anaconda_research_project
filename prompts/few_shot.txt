A person has typed "{query}" into a search engine.
Consider the following passage: {passage}
Split this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search. Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query (M). Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T). Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (O). Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {{"M": score, "T": score, "O": score}} Results {{}}
