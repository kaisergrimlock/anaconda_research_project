Judge only from the provided passage (don’t use outside knowledge).
Consider common query intents (informational, navigational, transactional). If ambiguous, pick the most probable informational intent.
If the query contains quotes, treat it as a request for those exact terms.
Ignore images/links unless described in the passage text.
If the passage is metadata-only (e.g., boilerplate, cookie banners), treat as non-answering.

Do not stray from the given parameters at any point. 
Label every single document, do not leave anything blank.
Assume that you are writing a report on the subject of the topic. 
A person has typed "{query}" into a search engine.
Consider the following passage: {passage}
Split this problem into steps: Consider the underlying intent of the search. 

For match (M):
3 (perfectly relevant): Direct, focused answer or uniquely on-topic content; answers the query clearly and fully (for the likely intent).
2 (highly relevant): Contains a correct/usable answer but surrounded by noise, partially complete, or requires minor inference.
1 (related): On the same topic/entity but does not answer the query (definitions/background/listings without the asked-for detail).
0 (irrelevant): Off-topic, contradictory to the query, or purely boilerplate.

For trustworthiness (T):
Consider sourcing signals visible in the passage (citations, author/affiliation, specificity, internal consistency, datedness if stated).
3: Strong sourcing/authority, specific details, internally consistent.
2: Generally credible text without clear sourcing issues.
1: Vague claims, marketing fluff, noticeable hedging, or minor inconsistencies.
0: Evident misinformation, contradictions, or spammy/templated content.

For overall (O):
Start with O = M.
If T = 0 and the passage makes factual claims central to answering, reduce O by 1 (floor at 0).
If M = 2 and T = 3 (highly credible) and the answer is only slightly obscured, you may increase O to 3.
Otherwise, keep O = M.
Clamp to 0–3.

Also consider these edge cases:
Multiple intents: If the passage satisfies one plausible high-frequency intent for the query, score against that; don’t average intents.
Negations/opposites: If the passage addresses the opposite of what’s asked (e.g., “how not to …” vs “how to …”), likely M=1 unless it still directly answers.
Lists/tables: If the exact requested item/data point is present, consider M≥2; if the category is right but the item is missing, M=1.
Comparisons: If the query asks “best X” and the passage ranks/compares X with rationale including the requested X, M≥2; generic sales copy without comparison is M=1.

Strictly produce a JSON array of scores without providing any reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON array. Example: {{"M": score, "T": score, "O": score}} Results {{}}
